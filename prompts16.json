In the area of gender equality and empowerment of women, the government of Rwanda recognizes the centrality of gender mainstreaming across all sectors and continues to explore and review relevant policies and legal instruments to ensure that gender equality and empowerment of women and girls are anchored on strong policy and legal frameworks. It is in the same goal that the government of Rwanda and partners have implemented the policy actions provided by the 2010 National Gender Policy as the first policy on gender by translating the Vision 2020 aspirations, with focus on gender promotion and empowerment of women and girls. There are noticeable achievements from implementing the previous policy mainly in areas of gender mainstreaming in various sectors and creation of policy, legal, and institutional foundation supporting all interventions on gender equality, equity, and women’s empowerment. Cognizant of achievements inherited from the previous policy and efforts made by the Government of Rwanda and its partners, the emphasis of this policy is to ensuring that gender equality concepts and principles are well understood and applied by all. The policy will further strengthen preestablished foundation not only by addressing the remaining policy gaps in mainstreaming gender across sectors and ensuring that sector-specific planning and implementation of programs that are gender responsive but also proposes mechanisms for addressing the persistent cultural norms and stereotypes hindering the effectiveness of gender equality and equity. Unlike the 2010 National Gender Policy, the 2021 gender policy emphasizes on effective engagement of men and boys and accelerating gender mainstreaming in the private sector – the engine of the Rwanda’s economy. Thus, the vision of this National Gender Policy is for Rwanda to become a nation that enjoys gender equality and equity towards national and sustainable transformation. The mission is to ensure that gender gaps across sectors are addressed through accelerating effectiveness of gender mainstreaming, gender responsive interventions, and gender accountability to position Rwanda as a global model in promoting gender equality. The overall goal of this policy is to improve gender equality and equity in various sectors while increasing women’s access to productive economic resources and opportunities and ensuring that women and men are free from any form of genderbased violence and discrimination. The policy objectives aim to: (1) Strengthen the gender mainstreaming and accountability across national sector policies, planning frameworks and strategies in public and private sector; (2) Ensure equal access and control of productive resources and economic opportunities for women and men, boys and girls; (3) Improve gender equality in education, health and social protection programs; (4) Identify gaps and address persistent cultural norms, gender stereotypes, and imbalances affecting the principles of gender equality and equity between women and men and girls and boys; (5) Ensure effective boys and men’s engagement programs and strategies in gender promotion; (6) Strengthen the mechanisms for promoting women’s participation in leadership and decisionmaking positions; (7) Increase knowledge on gender equality and equity in public and private sectors as well as among citizens in general; (8) Guarantee a conducive legal, policy, and institutional arrangement for the promotion of gender equality and equity. The above policy objectives were formulated in alignment with the Government of Rwanda’s endorsed agendas both at regional and international levels, including, the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); African Union Gender Policy (2009); East Africa gender policy, the African Union Agenda 2063; COMESA gender policy; HeForShe commitment of 2015; etc. Furthermore, this gender policy was developed in 2020 – the year that marks the transitioning from the Vision 2020 to the Vision 2050 whose aspirations are to provide high quality livelihoods and living standards to all Rwandans. Therefore, this gender policy supports the positioning of the Gender Equality and Women Empowerment and defines its vital role in the Rwanda’s transformational agenda by strengthening the role of men and boys and their engagement as key actors in promoting gender equality and equity in Rwanda. The development of this policy has been informed by an extensive situation analysis conducted with involvement of different stakeholders and members of the Rwandan community. Issues identified are related to deficiencies observed at the level of gender mainstreaming and accountability in the national planning processes, limited access to productive resources, gender inequalities in access to education, health, and social protection services, persistent cultural norms and gender stereotypes, limited women’s participation in leadership especially in decentralized government entities and in the private sector, and limited specific gender related expertise needed to effectively mainstream gender and empower women in various sectors. To address these issues, this policy is structured around the following eight priority areas as detailed below: Priority area 1: Engendering national planning frameworks, sector policies, strategies as well as programs and initiatives in public and private sectors. The overall objective is to strengthen the gender mainstreaming and accountability across national planning frameworks, sector policies and strategies in public and private sector. Priority area 2: Accelerate women’s economic empowerment: the aim to ensure equal access and control of productive resources and economic opportunities for women and men, boys and girls. Priority area 3: Continuous promotion of gender equality and equity in education, health and social protection sectors aiming at improving gender equality and equity in education, health and through social protection interventions. Priority area 4: Leverage on positive cultural norms that support best practices for gender promotion. This intends to identify, map gender best practices and address persistent cultural norms, gender stereotypes, and imbalances affecting the principles of gender equality and equity between women and men and girls and boys. Priority area 5: Men’s and boys’ engagement in gender promotion. This intends to ensure effective boys and men’s engagement programs and strategies in gender promotion. Priority area 6: Increase women’s meaningful participation and representation in leadership and decision-making positions in public and private sector as well as CSOs at all levels. The intention is to strengthen mechanisms for promoting women’s meaningful participation in leadership and decision-making positions. Priority area 7: Enhance gender specific capacity development with the aim to increase knowledge on gender equality and equity in public and private sectors as well as among communities in general. Priority area 8: Conducive Legal Framework for Gender equality, aiming at guaranteeing a conducive legal, policy, and institutional arrangement for the promotion of gender equality and equity. The proposed implementation approach of this policy should be guided by gender gap analysis that informs real gender issues, provides a good knowledge of the gender gaps in every sector, leading not only to gender sensitive but also gender responsive interventions across sectors. The policy proposes further a shift in the understanding of gender concept and make this well contextualized at sector level based on specific sector gender gap analysis and gender mainstreaming strategies. This has to be done based on guidelines to be provided by the Gender Machinery institutions headed by the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion. More enforcement is also needed to ensure inter-sectorial collaboration which simply justifies the crosscutting nature of gender among others. With regard to institutional framework required for effective implementation of the proposed policy actions, this gender policy emphasizes on an integrated multi-sectoral approach while it at the same time strengthens accountability vis à vis to gender equality and equity in Rwanda. Finally, a five-year implementation strategy of this policy has been developed to guide interventions by all actors. In addition, roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders are clearly defined in the implementation framework of this policy, calling for more integrated and inclusive approaches in the planning and implementation of the proposed policy actions. 1. General introduction 1.1. Definition of key concepts The definitions of gender related concepts used in this policy are drawn from a range of literature, but mainly from United Nations Children’s Fund “Gender Equality Glossary Terms and Concepts” as detailed in the following paragraphs:  Gender: Gender is a social and cultural construction, which distinguishes differences in the attributes of men and women, girls and boys, and accordingly refers to the roles and responsibilities of men and women. It also refers to the state of being male or female in relation to the social and cultural roles that are considered appropriate for men and women2 .  Gender Equality: implies that women and men, girls and boys have equal conditions, treatment and opportunities for realizing their full potential, human rights and dignity, and for contributing to (and benefitting from) economic, social, cultural and political development. Gender equality is, therefore, the equal valuing by society of the similarities and the differences of men and women, and the roles they play. It is based on women and men being full partners in the home, community and society. Equality does not mean that women and men will become the same but that women’s and men’s rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female.  Gender Equity: is the process of being fair to men and women, boys and girls. It refers to differential treatment that is fair and positively addresses a bias or disadvantage that is due to gender roles or norms or differences between the sexes. Equity ensures that women and men and girls and boys have an equal chance, not only at the starting point, but also when reaching the finishing line.  Empowerment: Refers to increasing the personal, political, social or economic strength of individuals and communities. Empowerment of women and girls concerns women and girls gaining power and control over their own lives. It involves awareness-raising, building selfconfidence, expansion of choices, increased access to and control over resources and actions to transform the structures and institutions which reinforce and perpetuate gender discrimination and inequality.  Financial inclusion: In this context, financial inclusion is referred to as of physical access to financial institutions, eligibility, update and usage of financial products and services including informal needed to accelerate and meet women and men consumers’ aspirations3  Gender mainstreaming: It is a strategy for making girls’ and women’s, as well as boys’ and men’s, concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes so that girls and boys and women and men benefit equality, and inequality is not perpetuated.  Gender Sensitive: Programmes and policies that are aware of and address gender differences. It also refers to as the state of knowledge of the socially constructive differences between women and men, including differences in their needs as well as the use of such knowledge to identify and understand the problems arising from such differences and to act purposively to address them. It also refers to a mindset where people recognize or are aware of gender-based discrimination which hinders enjoyment of human rights. It is an understanding and routine consideration of the social economic and cultural factors underlining discrimination based on sex whether against women and men4 .  Gender responsiveness: It refers to the planning process in which programs, policy and actions are developed to deal with and counteract problems which arise out of socially constructive differences between men and women.  Gender-responsive budgeting (GRB): Planning, programming and budgeting that contributes to the advancement of gender equality and the fulfillment of women's rights. It entails identifying and reflecting needed interventions to address gender gaps in sector and local government policies, plans and budgets. GRB also aims to analyze the gender differentiated impact of revenue-raising policies and the allocation of domestic resources and Official Development Assistance.  Gender stereotyping: implies ascribing certain attributes, characteristics and roles to people based on their gender. Gender stereotypes can be negative (i.e., women are bad drivers, men can’t change diapers) and benign (i.e., women are better caregivers, men are stronger). It also refers to constant portrayal in the media, the press or in education of men and men occupying certain roles according to the socially constructed gender division of labor and expectation in behavior. It also means, confusing what is believed to be natural with what is expected of individuals of their gender roles. Gender stereotyping becomes harmful when it limits a person’s life choices, such as training and professional path, and life plans.  Affirmative action: A set of procedures designed to increase the representation of members of a disadvantaged group by redressing discrimination or bias through active measures aimed at compensating historical and social disadvantages that limit members of that particular group from operating on a level playing field .  Unpaid Care work: Unpaid care work refers to all unpaid services provided within a household for its members, including care of persons, housework and voluntary community work. These activities are considered work, because theoretically one could pay a third person to perform them. .  Gender Analysis: is a critical examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, opportunities and rights/entitlements affect men, women, girls and boys in certain situations or contexts. Gender analysis examines the relationships between females and males and their access to and control of resources and the constraints they face relative to each other.  Gender gap: is disproportionate difference between men and women and boys and girls, particularly as reflected in attainment of development goals, access to resources and levels of participation. A gender gap indicates gender inequality.  Engendering: The process of ensuring that planning and programming is appropriate for and takes into account the different needs and concerns of females and males. It focuses on gender sensitiveness, responsiveness and accountability towards national transformation.  Gender Based Violence: GBV is violence directed against a person on the basis of sex and or gender. It includes acts that inflict physical, mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life. Gender-based violence involves the abuse of power. Gender-Based Violence affects women, men and boys and girls as individuals in families, communities and the nation.  Gender parity: This is a numerical concept referring to equal number of girls and women, boys and men relative to their respective numbers in the population. Ferrant, Pesando and Nowacka (2014). Unpaid Care Work: the missing link in the analysis of gender gaps in labour outcomes. OECD Development Centre. 1.2. Background Rwanda has increased its commitment to gender equality promotion since the signing of the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BDfA), just one year after the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. The institutionalization of gender promotion by establishing the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion, the Gender Monitoring Office, and other members of the gender machinery to ensure gender promotion and accountability is part of great achievements Rwanda has made in this regard. The country has managed as well to deliver on other commitments in promoting gender equality and empowerment of women both in terms strategic planning and program implementation. Since the inception of the Vision 2020, Rwanda has made tremendous efforts in promoting Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (GEWE). Gender equality is indeed one of the cross-cutting issues in the Vision 2020 and its subsequent implementation strategies such as the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategies (EDPRS1&2) and the current National Strategy for Transformation (NST-1). Promoting gender equality and equality entails initiating a series of reforms aiming at creating conducive environment, especially in areas legal and institutional arrangement, education, fighting against poverty, eliminating all forms of discrimination and adopting positive measures for women to access economic opportunities, especially those related to employment, access to finance, access to employable skills, and access to markets7 . With regard to legal framework, the 2003 Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda amended in 2015 stresses on gender equality by conferring at least 30% of positions to women in all decisionmaking organs. This resulted in significant improvement of women’ representation in government (both at central and decentralized levels), the parliament, the judiciary and the private sector. In addition, Rwanda has put in place laws and legal instruments for strengthening GEWE in the planning and budgeting processes, matrimonial regimes, donation and successions, land access as well as the prevention and punishment of Gender-Based Violence criminalizes GBV offenses among others. In area of economic empowerment of women, commendable achievements have been registered in gender parity with respect to land ownership between men and women and increased access to finance and financial inclusion for both men and women and increased access to and use of ICT. For instance, in education, Rwanda has achieved a stable gender parity in primary and secondary education with increasing trend of girls’ participation in Science, Technology Engineering and Math. Similar trends are also observed on key health indicators especially those related to child, maternal and reproductive health. Overall, GEWE are mainstreamed in all national development frameworks, including Vision 2020, the sector and district development strategies. Gender equality principles have also informed the formulation of the National Strategy for Transformation (NST, 2018-2024) and the Vision 2050. The 2010 National Gender Policy was the first national gender policy in Rwanda, translating the Vision 2020 aspirations as far as gender promotion is concerned. The overall objective of the policy was to promote gender equality and equity in Rwanda through a clearly defined process for mainstreaming gender across all sectors of development. Further, the policy defined the institutional framework and mechanisms within which gender equality and equity policies and programs were designed, implemented, monitored and evaluated, and coordinated. It thus, guided on how to mainstream gender into the various sector specific policies, strategies, and planning frameworks. For Rwanda to achieve GEWE commitments in the perspectives of the new vision 2050 and NST1, it has proven paramount to review the 2010 National Gender Policy and ensure that policy interventions under the revised gender policy reflect new aspirations and continued efforts to promoting gender equality and women’s economic empowerment. Furthermore, this Gender Policy aims also to ensure alignment with the Government of Rwanda’s endorsed agendas both at regional and international levels, including:  HeForShe commitment in 2015 – an invitation for men and people of all genders to stand in solidarity with women to create a bold, visible and united force for gender equality.  East Africa gender policy, the African Union Agenda 2063 adopted in 2015 stipulates that Africa of 2063 will have full gender parity, with women occupying at least 50% of elected public offices at all levels and half of managerial positions in the public and the private sectors8 . The economic and political glass ceiling that restricted women’s progress will have been shattered.  COMESA gender policy9 stressing on mainstreaming gender in all its regional activities in order to ensure that both females and males equitably participate and benefit from regional development.  African Union Gender Policy (2009) emphasizes on advocating for the promotion of a gender responsive environment and practices as well as the enforcement of human rights, gender equality and women’s empowerment commitments made at international, continental, regional and Member States levels among others.  Women Peace and Security Agenda (WPS): United Nations Security Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security adopted in 2000 is a landmark in the recognition of women as key Actors in conflict prevention, management, resolution, peace building and reconciliation processes as well as the most victims of all forms of insecurity and violence during conflicts. Therefore, it calls for Mainstreaming gender perspective in all decisionmaking process and elimination of GBV in all its forms and levels. Rwanda is one of a few countries who domesticated WPS agenda through elaboration of National Action Plans (NAPs). In 2009, Rwanda developed a 3-year NAP (2009-2012) for the implementation of the UNSCR 1325; and a 2 nd generation of NAP (2018-2022) was launched in March 2019 as the output of the commendable efforts and experiences got from the implementation and evaluation of the previous NAP.  Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promoting women and girls, equal rights and opportunity everywhere in the world and ensure that women and girls are able to live free of violence and discrimination. Women’s equality and empowerment is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but also integral to all dimensions of inclusive and sustainable development10 . 1.3. Rationale for the review of the Gender policy The review of the 2010 National Gender Policy is justified by four major reasons: firstly, despite commendable efforts by the Government of Rwanda in gender education and establishing both the legal and institutional framework for gender promotion, more efforts are still needed to ensure that gender equality concepts and principles are well understood among different categories of Rwandans. In addition, the mainstreaming of gender across sectors remains with some technical gaps, leading to the planning and implementation of programs that are less gender responsive. Persistent cultural norms and stereotypes affect the effectiveness of gender promotion and adoption of gender equality principles. Furthermore, building an effective gender accountability system has proven to be challenging since the inception of the 2010 National Gender Policy. Therefore, these prevailing issues as well as other emerging ones call for new policy direction and actions. Second, the 2018/19 fiscal year marks the second year of implementation of the Government of Rwanda’s seven-year program – the National Strategy for Transformation (NST1, 2017-2024), bridging between the visions 2020 and 2050. The key aspirations of the vision 2050 include to provide high quality livelihoods and living standards to Rwandans. Consequently, the review of the National Gender Policy is initiated to support the positioning of GEWE and define its vital role in the anticipated Rwanda’s socioeconomic transformation. Third, the revised National Gender Policy is meant to reiterate the Rwanda’s commitments and domestication of the regional and international agenda and instruments.These include Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979), Beijing Platform for Action (1995), Maputo Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (2003), Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa (2004), the East Africa Gender Policy, COMESA gender policy, AU Gender Policy, Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Africa Union Agenda 2063 and HeForShe commitments (2015) among others. 10 SDG5: Achieve Gender equality and empower all women and girls Fourth, unlike the public sector, gender mainstreaming in the private sector has not received due attention in the previous policy and related interventions and programs, calling for effective and transformative gender mainstreaming in the private sector. Furthermore, the role of men and boys in promoting gender equality and equity remains with noticeable deficiencies as regard to their engagement partly explained by lack of specific strategies for men and boys’ engagement, constituting an additional area of interest for this policy. Therefore, this policy builds on the achievements of the previous policy and proposes policy actions to address the identified intervention gaps and new emmerging issues pertaining gender equality and equity in Rwanda. 1.4. Policy Review Process The review of the National Gender Policy resulted from a multi-stage process, involving a desk review, a situational analysis, consultations with key partners and stakeholders, and validation through various forums. (1) Situational Analysis: the first step towards the development of this gender policy was an extensive review of gender related documentation comprising gender reports and publications as well as policy and strategic documents. The aim was not only to assess the status of gender equality in Rwanda but also the extent to which gender is mainstreamed in other national policy and strategic document across sectors. At this stage, an assessment of legal and institutional frameworks supporting GEWE were also conducted. (2) Consultations were done among different stakeholders at central level. At central level, entities consulted include the Ministry of Gender and Family promotion (MIGEPROF), Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN), Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC), Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI), Gender Monitoring Office (GMO), National Women’s Council (NWC), Pro-femmes Twese Hamwe, Chamber of women entrepreneurs in PSF, Center of Gender Studies at UR, Religious Leaders Forum, UN WOMEN, CARE International, Action Aid International and RWAMREC. Many other public and private entities as well as international organizations were consulted during the validation workshop. (3) Consultations at local government and community level were conducted in ten Districts - two districts in each province covering all Provinces plus the City of Kigali. In each District, two sectors were randomly selected in which different categories of people (women and men, youth, business women, gender clubs at schools) were consulted to gather their understanding, knowledge and experiences of the gender concept in their daily lives as well as their perspectives on the new gender policy orientation. The choice of these districts was mainly based on rural-urban divide as gender dynamics vary from rural to urban contexts. Other gender related aspects like norms and practices that might be specific to certain areas have also been considered. From each sampled district, two sectors were selected following the same rule of rural-urban divide with one sector close to the district office thus being considered as having urban or semi-urban features and another one located far from the district. Districts sampled in each of the provinces and the City of Kigali and related sectors are highlighted below: Kicukiro and Gasabo in City of Kigali; Kamonyi and Gisagara in the South; Rubavu and Rusizi in the West; Musanze and Burera in the North; and Bugesera and Nyagatare in the Eastern Province. At least two sectors in each district were considered for the focus group discussions with citizens. (4) Sequential validation meetings and workshops with members of the inter-ministerial committee and development partners. At the beginning of this review process, a technical committee of focal persons representing some relevant government institutions and partner organizations was formed to validate sequential drafts of this gender policy before it is proposed to the cabinet approval process. 2. Gender in the National, Regional, and Global Context 2.1. National Legal Framework for Gender 2.1.1. Gender in the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda The Government of Rwanda is strongly committed to promoting equality and equity amongst all Rwandans by ensuring that socially and historically disadvantaged as well as vulnerable people are the main beneficiaries of its pro-poor programs. Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda of 2003 amended in 2015 stipulates that “All Rwandans are born and remain equal in rights and freedoms”, discrimination based on ethnic origin, skin colour or race, sex, economic categories, economic status, physical or mental disability…are prohibited and punishable by law”. In this regard, the Constitution guarantees representation in the parliament for special categories of Rwandans including youth, women, people with disabilities and the historically marginalized people. More specifically for women, the constitution of the Republic of Rwanda confers at least 30% of positions to women in all decision-making organs11. In Rwanda therefore, promoting GEWE is primarily a human right issue, encompassing women and girls' equal rights, combatting discriminatory practices and challenging the roles and stereotypes that propagate inequalities and exclusion. 2.1.2. Gender in other key laws and legal instruments Throughout the implementation of the 2010 National Gender Policy, Rwanda has also put in place an enabling legal framework to strengthening GEWE, including among others: a) Organic Budget Law N o 12/2013, instituting Gender-responsive Budgeting: This law enforces accountability measures for gender sensitive resource allocation across sectors, programmes and projects through Gender Budget Statements - a mandatory annex of the Budget Framework Paper submitted to both chambers of Parliament. b) Law Nº 27/2016 of 08/07/2016 governing matrimonial regimes, donations and successions: This law provides equal treatment of legitimate children in succession without any discrimination between male and female children and right of the surviving spouse to take part in succession. c) Law Nº 32/2016 of 28/08/2016 Governing Persons and Family: The law governs persons and family as well as relations between persons. It contains different provisions relating to rights and obligations of both men and women. d) Law N° 003/2016 of 30/03/2016 Establishing and Governing Maternity Leave benefits Scheme: The Law establishes and governs maternity leave benefits scheme. It guarantees security for women employment and the protection of the child. e) Law N° 43/2013 of 16/06/2013 governing land in Rwanda: This law guarantees equal rights for men and women on land access, ownership and utilization. f) Law N° 66/2018 of 30/08/2018 regulating labor in Rwanda. This provides for protection of workers against gender-based violence and any kind of harassment at the work place. g) Law Nº 68/2018 of 30/08/2018 determining offences and penalties in general provide punishment of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) that was before considered as family matter. This was further reinforced by the Organic Law No 01/2012/OL of 02/05/2012 instituting the Penal Code especially on issues of criminalizing child defilement, human trafficking, marital rape, forced marriage. h) Law No 71/2018 of 31/08/2018 relating to the protection of the child rights: This guarantees the protection of all children against abuse. i) Prime Minister's Order N°001/03 of 11/01/2012 determining modalities in which Government Institutions Prevent and Respond to Gender Based Violence: The order gives responsibility to all Government institutions for GBV prevention and Response and Reporting. 2.2. Gender in the National Policy and Planning Framework 2.2.1. Gender in the Rwanda’s Vision 2020 and 2050 With a share of 52%, women make up the majority of the Rwandan population (RPHC4, 2012). According to the vision 2020, promoting gender equality and equity requires primarily to update and adapt national laws on gender. It also entails to support education for all, fight against poverty and practice a positive discrimination policy in favour of women with a focus in Technical Vocational Education Training, tertiary level and in employment opportunities. Further, gender will continue to be integrated as a cross-cutting issue in all development policies and strategies at both central and local government levels. Gender is one of the core values of the Vision 2050 that aims for Rwanda to reach upper middle income by 2035 and high income by 2050. The aim is to ensure gender equality and equality through inclusive development model (promoting gender equality, pro-poor interventions, unity and solidarity). This entails greater consideration of gender as an enabling development approach towards sustainable transformation and development. 2.2.2. National Strategy for Transformation (NST1) Gender and Family Promotion is one of the cross-cutting areas under the National Strategy for transformation (NST1 2017-2024) and emphasizes on interventions geared to: promote access to finance for women, mainstreaming gender in employment and job creation strategies, capacity development of the gender machinery and scaling-up Early Childhood Development (ECD) services at village levels as well as strengthening and promoting gender equality and ensure equal opportunities for all Rwandans. Among other NST1 priorities include strengthening of the prevention and response strategies to fight against gender-based violence (GBV) and child abuse through establishing and strengthening family cohesion, home grown initiatives, implementation of integrated health care services for GBV victims in partnership with the Private sector, CSOs, Faith Based Organizations as well community awareness campaigns. 2.2.3. Gender in specific sector policies and strategies Gender is considered a cross-cutting priority area in the national planning and strategic frameworks which in turn is translated into workable programmes and projects through the Sector Strategic Plans (SSPs) at central level and District Development Strategies (DDSs) at District level. More specifically, it is planned that each sector would have a gender mainstreaming strategy which entails its specific strategies for gender promotion, this was a policy provision of the 2010 national gender policy. With respect to gender accountability, the government of Rwanda has put in place gender accountability mechanisms including Gender Response Budgeting (GRB) which is implemented through the Gender Budget Statement to ensure gender accountability both at central and local government level. In each SSP and DDS, there is M&E Framework that provides guidance on both gender output and outcome related indicators to assess the performance on gender responsive interventions. 2.2.4. Gender in District Development Strategy (DDS) In 2018, all districts in Rwanda developed their DDS translating their intended development aspirations over the course of NST-1. The DDSs emphasize on strengthening and promoting gender equality and ensure equal opportunities for all Rwandans. Women and youth employment are another area of focus for DDSs. Indeed, DDSs prioritize the creation of descent and productive work though the National Employment Program (NEP), reduction of women poverty and fighting against Gender Based Violence (GBV). These aspects are also reflected in the annual action plans and performance contracts/Imihigo districts. 2.3. Institutional Framework for Gender In its commitment to ensure effective promotion of gender equality and women’s empowerment, the GoR has put in place strong institutional framework known as the National Gender Machinery composed of the following four institutions:  Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF) is the Central Government institution mandated to ensure strategic formulation and coordination of policies implementation in the area of gender, family, women's empowerment and children's issues.  Gender Monitoring Office (GMO) is an organ instituted by Article 139 of the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda of 2003 amended in 2015 with the role of monitoring gender mainstreaming in all sectors by all stakeholders and progress towards gender equality.  National Women’s Council (NWC) is a forum whose mission is to build women’s capacity and ensure their participation in national development through advocacy and social mobilization. The NWC is composed of committees (each with seven members) at national, provincial and local decentralized administrative entities.  Rwandan Forum for Women Parliamentarians (FFRP) with the mandate of lobbying and advocacy for gender responsive laws and commitment to gender equality principles within the parliament and other government institutions, as well as, promotion and protection of human rights including those specific to women and children. 2.4. Gender in the Regional and International Context Actions of Rwanda with respect to gender promotion are not isolated from the regional and global context. The review of the later helps to position this policy in the regional and global context and to ensure that it responds to various gender related commitments that Rwanda has committed to or ratified as below described:  Ratification of the international bill of rights in April 1975.  Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women in 1980 and ratified it in 1981.  Adoption of the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action marked a turning point for Rwanda’s commitments to promote GEWE.  The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, commonly known as Maputo Protocol in 2004. Further, in order to strengthen the mechanisms to combat violence against women and children in times of war and peace, the Government of Rwanda is a member state of the International Conference of the Great Lakes and is also a signatory to the Protocol on the Prevention and Suppression of Sexual Violence against Women and Children. 2.4.1. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) By nature, gender cuts across a range of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the 2030 Development Agenda. But the Agenda 2030 dedicates a standalone SDG- the fifth SDG on “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”. The SGDs gender related indicators are domesticated in the national development framework such as NST-1, sector strategies and DDS. Priority areas under SDG 5 include: eliminating all forms of discrimination against all women and girls, elimination of all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation, eliminating all harmful practices such as child labour, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation and ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life among others. 2.4.2. Gender in the African Union Agenda 2063 Adopted in 2013, the African Union Agenda 2063 is a shared framework for inclusive growth and sustainable development for Africa to be realized in the next fifty years. The agenda, builds on and seeks to accelerate the implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development12 . With regard to gender, the agenda emphasizes on the women’s empowerment in all spheres of social, economic and political lives leading to inclusive economic growth with expanded job opportunities, especially for the youth and women. In the same area, the agenda, envisions an African continent where no child, woman or man will be left behind. 2.4.3. Gender in the EAC Vision 2050 According to the East African Community (EAC), mainstreaming GEWE is crucial ensuring the participation of women in the transformation of the region. The vision recognizes that no society can reach its full potential, unless it empowers women and remove all obstacles to women’s full participation in all areas of human endeavours13. Through the vision, the EAC region stresses the harmonization of gender policies in order to facilitate gender equality and women’s empowerment. The EAC vision 2050 also intends to remove the severe regional gender related disparities such as girls’ education, equality and equity in terms of political and economic participation as well as rural settings affecting gender equality. 2.4.4. Gender in the African Charter of Human and People’s Rights The Protocol to the African charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa was adopted in July 2003. Under the protocol, States Parties committed to combat all forms of discrimination against women through appropriate legislative, institutional and other measures, including14: (i) In their national constitutions and other legislative instruments, if not already done, the principle of equality between women and men and ensure its effective application (ii) Enact and effectively implement appropriate legislative or regulatory measures, including those prohibiting and curbing all forms of discrimination particularly those harmful practices which endanger the health and general well-being of women; Integrate a gender perspective in their policy decisions, legislation, development plans, programmes and activities and in all other spheres of life; (iii) Take corrective and positive action in those areas where discrimination against women in law and in fact continues to exist; (iv) Support the local, national, regional and continental initiatives directed at eradicating all forms of discrimination against women; State parties also committed themselves to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of women and men through public education, information, education and communication strategies, with a view to achieving the elimination of harmful cultural and traditional practices and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes, or on stereotyped roles for women and men. 3. Gender Situational Analysis 3.1. Gender and Economic Transformation 3.1.1. Access to productive resources a) Access to Land for agriculture and other investments: Since the completion of land registration in 2013, there is improvement in gender parity with respect to land ownership between men and women. The Beijing + 25 Rwanda Country Report shows that 59.9% of registered land is owned by married couples, 24.6%, owned by women and only 14.27% is owned by men15 . However, there is still a challenge linked to women’s limited bargaining power within the households on land use for agriculture as well as use of agriculture produces despite the existing protective legal framework and sensitization16. In addition, using land title as collateral is improving but still limited (38% of women access credits using land as collateral) due to other conditions that are hard for women to fulfil such as high interest rate and capacity to design bankable projects or business plans. b) Gender equality in agriculture: While access and use of improved seeds and inorganic fertilizers is generally limited for both men and women, the situation is more pronounced for female farmers. Only 8% of women use improved seeds and inorganic fertilizers compared to 18% of men. With regard to inorganic fertilizers, 15% of female farmers use inorganic fertilizers compared to 20% of male farmers. For organic fertilizers, usage follows the same trend with 75% of men compared to 45% of women in their respective groups, showing a disparity between men and women on input use for increased productivity17 Also, the women’s representation in extension services is still very low. For instance, women represent: 28% of farmers’ field school compared to 72% of men, 20% of Farmer Promoters against 80% of men, 18% of Sector level Agronomists against 82% of men. c) Access to Finance: The Government of Rwanda has given greater attention on financial inclusion and access to finance in the perspectives of Vision 2020 and now with NST-1. About 93% (6.7 million) of Rwandans are financially included, implying that they are using either formal or informal products/services to meet their financial needs (FinScope, 202018). Despite high financial inclusion rate, men are more financially included (81.3%) than women in formal banking compared to the informal sector where 11.9% of males are included against 18.5% of females. The limited access to finance hinders women’s ability to be economically empowered. Furthermore, the current understanding of financial inclusion that entails mainly ownership of an account in formal financial institutions (commercial banks, microfinance institutions and SACCOs) and proximity to any financial institution undermines the essence of financial inclusion which should in addition reflect people’s ability to access various financial products and services. Moreover, there is evidence of high risk averse and reluctance amongst women to apply for financial products initially designed to improve their access to finance (e.g., agricultural guarantee fund, rural investment facility, post-harvest grant and PRICE). d) Access to public tenders: A 2018 study on affirmative procurement in Rwanda found that out of 161 randomly selected tenders in 2016-2017, women owned business won only 11% of bids and that represent only 4% of the monetary value of all bids. This reflects a gender gap in service delivery where women seem to be much excluded and hence more limited financial capacity for women. Similarly, there is no mechanism to ensure gender equality in implementation of public tenders commissioned19 . 3.1.2. Entrepreneurship, Business development and Employment a) Entrepreneurship and Business development: Gender equality in entrepreneurship and business development requires engagement of both men and women and calls for specific skills and capacities which partly explain low involvement of women as compared to men. For instance, looking at the geographical distribution of SMEs and ownership by gender, the contrast is stark: 55% of urban establishments are male-owned compared to 45% women-owned, while in the rural areas, men own 83.4% of enterprises compared to 17% owned by women20 . In addition to existing skills gaps in entrepreneurship and business development, there are still issues with regard to access to start-up capital as well as lack of accompanying measures to ensure growth of start-ups after registration. Female owned businesses, entrepreneurs outside Kigali, and those operating out of the service sector, are funded by the World Bank report to be structurally constrained21(e.g., gender gaps in access to finance, skills gaps in entrepreneurship and business development, unpaid domestic work, etc.). b) Labour Participation: The unemployment rate in Rwanda has decreased over the last three years. Indeed, unemployment rate remains around 16% during August 2019 and August 2020 2223. Overall, female unemployment rate is high, with 19.7% (in 2020 Q3) compared to 13% for male over the same time. Furthermore, the labour force participation rate is 43.7% for female and 61.9 for males in August 2020. Women remain underrepresented in the labour force and especially amongst senior management position and as CEOs of larger companies. The ability of women to improve their participation in the labour force depends on skills and knowledge acquired vis-à-vis to the labour market, ability of the economy to generate descent jobs and cultural beliefs/attitudes which may prevent women to perform non-traditional jobs such as carpentry, construction, mechanical engineering, etc. c) Regional Integration: Rwanda belongs to many regional economic grouping such as the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL), the East African Community (EAC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the recently created Continental Free Trade of the African Union. These regional grouping give a range of opportunities to Rwandans, both men and women to develop their businesses, widen markets for goods and services produced in Rwanda and benefit from facilities that are provided under these regional economic groupings. For instance, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 76 and 104 of the EAC Treaty, the EAC common market Protocol provides for: the free movement of goods, free movement of persons, free movement of labour, the right of establishment, the right of residence, the free movement of services and the free movement of capital. More specifically, the protocol emphasizes on promoting equal opportunities and gender equality as well the promotion and protection of the rights of marginalized and vulnerable groups24. A challenge remains however on the extent to which the Rwandan men and women are optimally benefiting from opportunities offered through the regional economic groupings. 3.1.3. Limited access to agricultural extension services The current status of distribution of workers by main occupation shows that a high percentage of women (62.7%) are mainly occupied as skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers as opposed to other types of activities 25 against 43.1% of male. Despite the high proportion of women engaged in farming activities, the extent to which women are involved as extension agents is much lower than men, and there is a significant gender disparity within the sector. For instance, of the total farmer field school facilitators (2,547), only 34% are female and 42% of agricultural cooperatives membership. Furthermore, increase of women in proximity extension services has various advantages such as increased participation in various agricultural programs and improved role in the decision-making process about land use and farming system26 . 3.1.4. Access to ICT Increased access to ICT would translate into easy access to financial services such uptake of mobile money services, attendance and graduation in ICT related courses and use of E-learning facilities for women students. Major gender gaps are observed in these areas with about 36% and 37% of women attending and graduating from ICT related courses respectively. With regard to the use of financial mobile services (sending and receiving money), women are estimated at 56% compared to 68% of men. 3.1.5. Lack of access to alternative sources of energy Use of firewood remains the dominant source of cooking fuel amongst households headed by female (with 84.7%) with scarce access to alternative fuels such as (charcoal 13%), crop waste (0.8%), Gas (0.9%) and Bio-gas (0.6%). These figures show continuous and heavy reliance on firewood as the main source of energy for cooking and women and children are mainly responsible for providing this in their homes due to prevailing traditional norms and stereotypes. Consequently, this increases women’s workload which hinders their engagement in other productive activities. 3.2. Gender and Social Transformation 3.2.1. Gender parity in education Rwanda has achieved a stable gender parity in primary and secondary education with current girl’s enrollment at 49.7% and 53.2% in 201827 respectively due to various initiatives promoting girls’ education such as 12YBE and other affirmative actions. However, despite positive trends, female’s representation in ICT Education (41.8% in 2017), tertiary education (38%), TVET program (43.8% in 2018) and the number of girls enrolled in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM, 45.6% in 2018), remains relatively low compared to their male counterparts. 3.2.2. Access to reproductive health services There is evidence of improvements in key health indicators especially those related to child, maternal and reproductive health. However, the percentage of women using modern contraceptive methods of family planning remains low though it has gradually increased up to 58% in 2019/2020 from 48% in 2014/2015 and 45% in 2010. With regard to reproductive health, women still experience unmet needs, with 14% of currently married women having an unmet need for family planning services. Of married women in the age category of 15-49 years old, 10% want to have another child soon (within 2 next years) while 34% want to have another child later (in 2 or more years). Forty-nine percent of women want no more children whereas 2% have already been sterilized and 3% have declared infecund2829 . Consistent with the NST1, there is need for more efforts to enhance the demographic dividend by ensuring access to quality health for all; scale-up efforts to raise awareness on reproductive health and family planning to increase contraceptive prevalence from 48% (2013/14) to 60% in 2024. Clearly, recent RDHS (2019/2020) statistics show that the total demand for family planning for married women is 77.8%; this reflects a commendable progress. It is further anticipated from NST1 that this will be achieved through ensuring universal access to contraceptive information and services to avoid unplanned pregnancies and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases with a particular focus on the youth. 3.2.3. Poverty and Social protection Rwanda has made significant progress in reducing poverty amongst both men and women though women remain poorer than men. For instance, data from EICV5 shows that 39.5% of femaleheaded households are classified as poor compared to 37.6% of male-headed households in 2016/17 30 . Furthermore, with regard to social protection, women are the majority under the direct support program (58.3% against 41.7% of men on average for the period between 2013/14 and 2017/18) implying that women constitute the majority of vulnerable people benefiting from VUPDirect support. Clearly, women remain more affected by poverty than men. Furthermore, there is initiatives under VUP called E-Public Works31 mostly performed by women who are unable to participate in classic VUP-Public work program due caring responsibilities such as caring for young kids, elders and people with disabilities. 3.2.4. Water and sanitation Overall, access to improved sanitation has improved in Rwanda though the proportion of female HHs with access to improved sanitation facilities (80.6%) is low compared to that of male HHs (88.0%). In addition, while the number of male headed households with no toilet facilities has decreased (from 5.8% in 2010/11 to 2.8% in 2016/17), that of female headed households has increased (from 6.4% to 6.8%) over the same period. Generally, the overall access rate to improved sanitation facilities is high among Rwandan population. The proportion of female HHs with access to improved sanitation facilities (80.6%) is low compared to that of male HHs (88.0%). This is related to unequal income distribution between men and women headed HHs where women HHs mostly have low income compared to men headed HHs. The recent efforts to improve human security have tremendously increased the status of sanitation in general. 3.2.5. Gender Based Violence Occurrence and Service Delivery The existence and scale up of Isange One Stop Centres (IOSCs) across the country have played an important role in addressing GBV in general and improving service delivery to victims of GBV. Government efforts to extend IOSC services to health Centres will increase the reach out to GBV victims and contribute to improve prevention and response in this area. The existence of 44 IOSC in district hospitals coupled with community awareness on GBV have continuously increased the reporting og GBV cases by both male and female. 3.2.6. Men engagement in gender promotion The Government of Rwanda and partners acknowledge the need to engage men and boys in achieving gender equality and equity across sector by establishing non-discriminatory laws. For instance, the law Nº 32/2016 of 28/08/2016 governing persons and family prescribes how spouses (both female and male) are supposed to jointly manage the household, provide moral and material support to the household members as well as, maintain the home in all other aspects32 . Similarly, the Government of Rwanda and partners have also invested more in men engagement through men and boys centred approaches such as Men engage campaign and HeforShe movement, Gender Equality Seal Program for public and private enterprises and the establishment of Rwanda Men’s Resource Centre (RWAMREC), a civil society organisation promoting men’s engagement in promoting gender equality and equity. Despite these on-going initiatives, the analysis of the sector policies and strategies and stakeholders’ engagements revealed remaining gaps in the operationalisation of men engagement in gender promotion. This is partly explained by men’s resistance resulting from cultural norms, inadequate education on gender principles and dimensions as well as the use of approaches that are mainly skewed towards women and girls – ignoring the potential role of men and boys as key partners. 3.3. Gender and Transformational Governance 3.3.1. Women representation in decision-making organs The 2003 Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda with amendments through 2015 provides for equality of all Rwandans and between men and women which is affirmed by women occupying at least thirty percent (30%) of positions in decision-making organs. This constitutional guarantee has enabled high representation of women in decision making and governance processes in some governance entities while others have considered this quota as their ceiling and thus reserving their extra-efforts towards gender parity. a) Women representation in the Public Sector: Rwanda has made great efforts in improving women participation in decision making organs in the public sector. Indeed, Rwanda has the highest number of women member of parliaments (chamber of deputies) with 61.3%. Other women representation in high level Government include: 53.3% in the cabinet of Ministers, 41% of Permanent Secretaries in Ministries, 49.7% in the Judiciary, 26.7% of District mayors as well as 45.2% of District Councilors b) Women representation in the private Sector: A gender accountability programme (Gender Equality Seal) initiated by PSF, GMO, UN Women and UNDP is striving to promote gender accountability in the sector. Women’s representation in the private sector is still limited in numbers. In fact, women represent 30% of president of chambers in the private sector, 10% of the first presidency and 70% of the vice presidency of chambers in PSF34 . It is therefore clear that much more efforts are needed to bring more women on board especially in strategic positions in PSF. In addition, women’s representation in the labour force is still low compared to men with 45.3% while men’s participation stands at 63.2 %. Furthermore, women dominate in traditional female jobs such as cleaning services, hair dressing, tailoring, customer care, etc. which are less remunerating whilst men dominated jobs are much well-paying like construction, transport & logistics, etc. c) Women representation in Media: Women representation in media is still very low. According to the state of gender equality in Rwanda report, women represent 24.5% of accredited Journalists, 12.4% of chief editors and 14.1% owners of managers of media houses35. Concrete strategies are needed to encourage the participation of more women in the media sector. 3.2.1. Gender Mainstreaming In Rwanda, GEWE are mainstreamed in all development frameworks, including Vision 2020, the sector and district development strategies. Gender equality principles have also informed the formulation of the National Strategy for Transformation (NST, 2018-2024) and the Vision 2050. The Government of Rwanda through (MINECOFIN) issued the guidelines for gender mainstreaming in 2008 with the aim to provide a framework for gender mainstreaming in the planning and budgeting processes. This guide was developed to address deficiencies in gender planning and budgeting at central and district level. More specifically, the guidelines shed light on the steps to follow in mainstreaming the gender in planning and budgeting, including (i) guiding the development and implementation of initiatives/interventions/ programs that promote gender equality and (ii) providing detailed procedures to be undertaken by budget agencies/ stakeholders and subsequently formalize and institutionalize the gender budgeting process. 3.2.2. Gender Budgeting The Government of Rwanda has institutionalized the Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB) through the 2013 Organic Law No 12/2013 of November 2013 on State finances and property aimed at narrowing the gap in budget allocation and spending across sectors in order to respond to specific needs of men and women equitably. The process of engendering GRB into national accounting system in Rwanda is a positive step to ensure that government commitments to advance gender equality are matched with adequate funding. So far, through GRB, the government commitments to gender equality yielded positive results, especially in terms of gender accountability through gender budget statements. Despite efforts made in this regard, the allocation of the budget for gender equality interventions among public and private planning and budgeting institutions is still limited. Furthermore, the assessment36 on the previous gender budget statements reveal this to be more focused on social related interventions in promoting gender than economic and transformative interventions expected to have more impact in addressing gender inequalities. 4. Policy Vision, Mission, Objective, and Guiding Principles 4.1. Vision and Mission of the Policy A. Vision: A nation that enjoys gender equality and equity towards national and sustainable transformation. B. Mission of the Gender Policy: To ensure that gender gaps across sectors are addressed through accelerating effective gender mainstreaming, gender responsive interventions, and gender accountability mechanisms in order to positioning Rwanda as a global model in promoting gender equality. 4.2. Overall Policy Goal and Specific Policy Objectives A. Overall Policy Goal: The overall goal of this policy is to improve gender equality and equity in various sectors while increasing women’s access to economic resources and opportunities; by ensuring that women and men are free from any form of gender-based violence and discrimination. B. Specific Gender Policy objectives Specifically, the policy aims to: (1) Strengthen the gender mainstreaming and accountability across national sector policies, planning frameworks and strategies in public and private sector; (2) Ensure equal access and control of productive resources and economic opportunities for women and men, boys and girls; (3) Improve gender equality in education, health and social protection; (4) Identify, map and address persistent cultural norms, gender stereotypes, and imbalances affecting the principles of gender equality and equity between women and men and girls and boys; (5) Ensure effective boys and men’s engagement programs and strategies in gender promotion; (6) Strengthen the mechanisms for promoting women’s participation in leadership and decision-making positions; (7) Increase knowledge on gender equality and equity in public and private sectors as well as among citizens in general; (8) Guarantee a conducive legal, policy, and institutional arrangement for the promotion of gender equality and equity. 4.3. Guiding Principles  Gender equality is about women and men or girls and boys: gender should be understood as a status where women and men or boys and girls have equal rights and opportunities rather than being a social or a women issue.  The cross-cutting nature of gender should not compromise its relevance across sectors: gender being a cross-cutting issue implies its high relevance in all sectors instead of being overlooked and lacking ownership.  Gender equality is not only a social issue and human right principle but also an important approach for country’s transformation and sustainable development.  Women’s empowerment is seen both a social and economic capital for national development programs.  Political Will: there is enough political will from government and all players at all levels of governance including the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary, Civil Society, the Media, Private Sector, Youth and Faith Based Organizations in gender mainstreaming and accountability. 5. Policy Framework, Priorities, and Policy issues and actions 5.1. Policy Framework The proposed policy framework is structured around eight policy priority areas responding to the seven specific policy objectives as above described. The policy priority areas focus on engendering national transformation, ensure equal rights and access to economic opportunities and productive resources, eliminating negative cultural norms, stereotypes, and gender-based violence; increased and diversified mechanisms for improved ownership and gender accountability; continuous education and awareness about gender equality and equity; enforcement of laws, regulation, and supportive institutional arrangement. Furthermore, the formulation of this policy’s priority areas and objectives follows the key issues identified in the three pillars of NST1 as detailed in the situational analysis above (see section 3). As shown in chart 1 below, priority 2 and 7 address gender related issues identified under economic transformation pillar, priorities 1, 3 and 4 refer to gender related issues in the social transformation pillar, 6 and 8 address issues related to transformational governance while 5 is a cross-cutting priority area. Chart 1: Priority Areas and Policy Objectives Priority areas Policy Objectives Priority area 1: Engendering national planning frameworks, sector policies, strategies as well as programs and initiatives in public and private sectors. Objective 1: Strengthen the gender mainstreaming and accountability across national planning frameworks, sector policies and strategies in public and private sector. Priority area 2: Accelerate women’s economic empowerment Objective 2: Ensure equal access and control of productive resources and economic opportunities for women and men, boys and girls. Priority area 3: Continue to promote gender equality and equity in education, health and social protection sectors Objective 3: Improve gender equality and equity in education, health and social protection Priority area 4: Leverage on positive cultural norms that support best practices for gender promotion. Objective 4: Identify, map gender best practices and address persistent cultural norms, gender stereotypes, and imbalances affecting the principles of gender equality and equity between women and men and girls and boys.

Policy Priority Areas, Issues, and Actions Priority Area 1: Engendering national planning frameworks, sector policies, strategies as well as programs and initiatives in public and private sectors Objective 1: Strengthen the gender mainstreaming and accountability across national sector policies, planning frameworks and strategies in public and private sector. Policy Issue 1.1: Despite consideration of gender as a cross-cutting priority issue across the existing Sector Strategic Plans (SSPs), there are still gaps on how gender dimensions are integrated into these strategies. There is a tendency to treat gender as women and girls or limiting it to only social issue, leading to formulation of activities/interventions and programs across the board that are not gender responsive. Policy Actions 1.1.1. Improve the engendering of sector and district level strategic plans during the planning processes in public and private sectors. 1.1.2. Develop the remaining sector level gender mainstreaming strategies with specific related priorities and indicators to measure the performance on gender outcomes and ensure effective implementation. 1.1.3. Elaborate further gender mainstreaming guidelines specific to each sector to ensure good linkages between the SSPs, DDSs and their respective gender mainstreaming strategies outlining specific gender responsive programs and investments across the various socioeconomic sub-sectors in public and private sectors. 1.1.4. Reinforce the gender accountability mechanisms such as GRB and integrate the gender accountability as part of the national performance frameworks including Imihigo Performance contracts in public and private sectors. Policy Issue 1.2: Linked to the above issue, the M&E frameworks of Sector Plans and Strategies have indicators that are not sufficiently informed by gender gap analysis, hence difficult to ensure gender sensitive M&E system and performance measurement gender related outcomes across sectors. 1.2.1. Put in place sector specific guidelines and improve the existing ones to facilitate the development of gender sensitive M&E frameworks in public and private sectors. 1.2.2. Ensure compliance of gender sensitive M&E frameworks in public and private sectors. 1.2.3. Enhance the existing capacity in generating gender related data and statistics at central and decentralized level to inform the planning and implementation of gender responsive interventions as well as the gender profiling across sectors. 1.2.4. Strengthen the existing Gender Management Information System (GMIS) and its awareness to all GMIS users to support the monitoring, generation and publication of national and international regular gender status reports. Policy Issue 1.3: There is evidence of limited gender analysis prior to the planning processes both at central and district levels partly explained by constraints related to lack of required specific capacity for gender mainstreaming and accountability and hence limited institutional capacity to identify gender gaps across sectors. Policy Actions 1.3.1. Design and implement a national capacity development program on gender to improve gender analysis, gender mainstreaming and gender accountability across sectors at central and decentralized levels in public and private sectors. 1.3.2. Ensure that the planning processes (at central and decentralized levels) show differential programs and activities meant to uplift women and men towards gender equality and equity. 1.3.3. Increase ownership of gender responsive interventions by the planning and budgeting entities throughout the planning, implementation and M&E processes across sectors. 1.3.4. Ensure adequate integration of Rwanda’s international gender commitments into related sector plans. Priority Area 2: Accelerate women’s economic empowerment Objective 2: Ensure equal access and control of productive resources and economic opportunities for women and men, boys and girls Policy issue 2.1: Limited bargaining power of women in decision-making positions about the use and control of productive resources especially land, inequality in management and use of agricultural produces (especially for high value crops), misuse of power by men which affects the principle of consensus in decision making at household level as far as land and other resources for investments are concerned. Policy Actions 2.1.1. Strengthen/Capacitate existing community level mechanisms for promoting consensual decision making at household level (e.g. Inshuti z’Umuryango, Umugoroba w’Imiryango). 2.1.2. Continue to ensure gender equality in land use and control for productive purposes. 2.1.3. Design men and boys’ engage programs focusing on challenging negative masculinities, engaging participation of couples, increasing men's role in positive parenting to ensure gender responsive mindset towards a shared responsibility, use and control of assets and resources from and for investment 2.1.4. Promote Imihigo planning at household/family level reflecting the shared views of men and women, boys and girls on their annual planned activities and investments. Policy issue 2.2: Access to finance, especially for women remains a critical issue effecting their financial inclusion due to their limited capacity to comply with conditions pertaining financial products and services. These conditions include collateral requirements, bankable business plans, high interest rate which mostly affects women due to other specific factors such as low financial and ICT literacy rate, lack of self-confidence leading to risk averse, men’s resistance to allow women to use land as collateral. Furthermore, there is reluctance and lack of awareness amongst women to apply for financial products from various women’s guarantee schemes initially designed to improve their access to finance partly because they do not take into consideration the specific needs and abilities of women. Policy Actions 2.2.1. Improve access to formal finances for women by ensuring that financial inclusion goes beyond account ownership and geographical proximity but involves access and use of various bank products for investment. 2.2.2. Increase access and absorption capacities of women of existing and new financial products meant to improve their financial inclusion by ensuring that access conditions are gender sensitive. 2.2.3. Design financial literacy programs for women and men as well as boys and girls to increase their awareness on financing opportunities for their businesses 2.2.4. Increasing ICT literacy rate for both men and women and boys and girls to ensure effective use of ICT devises and access to related services without prejudice to their daily responsibilities. Policy issue 2.3: The current status of women participation in public tenders is still very limited whilst it remains men dominated. The current procurement law is less gender sensitive with no affirmative provisions to bridge the gender parity gaps in public procurement. This constitutes a missed opportunity for women to actively participate in productive economic activities for their economic empowerment. Policy Actions 2.3.1. Explore possibility of introducing incentives in the form of affirmative actions in the procurement policy and laws to ensure that women actively participate in public procurement and empower them to bid for bigger and remunerative projects. 2.3.2. Design capacity building interventions for women entrepreneurs to enhance their proficiency in areas such as procurement processes, use of e-procurement and other ICT facilities as well as tax laws and processes. 2.3.3. Create e-procurement that is friendly for both men and women to overcome different barriers including the language barrier. Policy issue 2.4: Participation of women in entrepreneurship and business development remains low due to lack of business-related specific skills and capacities, inadequate access to finance and start-up capital as well as heavy involvement of women in domestic activities including unpaid care work, limited use of alternative sources of energy for cooking restraining women to devote more of their time into other productive activities. In addition, there is no sufficient accompanying measures to support sustainable growth of start-ups including those owned by women. Policy Actions 2.4.1. Put in place more capital start-ups facilities and accompanying measures to ensure sustainable growth of new SMEs, especially those owned by women and girls. 2.4.2. Strengthen existing and establish new capacity development programs for women and girls in order to increase their capacity in entrepreneurship and business development and their participation in descent, well-paying and male dominated job opportunities such as in transport, mining and tourism. 2.4.3. Identify, document and address gender stereotypes in the private sector (e.g. productivity of women during pregnancy and lactation period, hiring young women vis- à-vis women above forty years, etc.). 2.4.4. Devise mechanisms and programs to ensure shared responsibility between men and women over domestic work/unpaid work as well as use of time and energy saving investments by securing alternative energy sources for cooking. These programs should target educating both men and women at community level for mindset change with regards to the benefits of shared responsibilities. 2.4.5. Explore possibilities of measuring/valuing unpaid work in the overall national GDP. 2.4.6. Scale up Early Childhood Development (ECD) Centers up to village37 level to ensure that women have time to dedicate to economic activities. Policy issue 2.5: Whereas the government priority areas comprises of agricultural transformation with focus to commercial farming, women who dominate the sector remain present at the subsistence level of agricultural value chain-production. This is mainly due to limited use of best agricultural practices which, in turn, is explained by inadequate access to agricultural inputs and extension services among others. Policy Actions 2.5.1. Increase women’s participation in proximity agricultural extension services delivery which has the potential to increase women’ enthusiasm and comfort in participating in various agricultural programs; 2.5.2. Mobilize and build the capacity of women to participate in more productive agricultural value chains (agro-processing, post-harvest process, irrigation among others) through cooperatives and agri-businesses. Policy issue 2.6: The situational analysis conducted under this policy revealed critical challenges linked to access to sources of energy and water, where there is continuous and heavy reliance on firewood as the main source of energy for cooking and women and children are mainly responsible for providing this in their homes due to prevailing traditional norms and stereotypes. Consequently, this increases women’s workload which hinders their engagement in other productive activities. In addition, there still need to improve access to water, both in terms of geographical location but also regular supply of clean water. With regard to sanitation, despite observed improvements and commitments by the Government of Rwanda to ensure access to improved sanitation, more efforts are needed to maintain the progress and ensure that the remaining gender parity gaps in sanitation are addressed as a pre-requisite for eradicating related human security issues. Policy Actions 2.6.1. Increase women and men’s access to affordable and reliable sources of clean energy. 2.6.2. Increase water supply facilities to address the traditional divisions of labour within households making water fetching a female task. 2.6.3. Continue to improve access to sanitation facilities and mass education for behavioral change towards best practices for sanitation within communities. Policy issue 2.7: The main environmental problem faced by Rwandans is climate change followed by soil erosion, landslides, destructive rains, floods and lose of soil fertility. Despite efforts made by the Government of Rwanda and its partners to address the above issues, there is need to improve the adaptive capacities to climate change and variability for both men and women. Policy Actions 2.7.1. Increase the adaptive capacities to all forms of climate change and variability hazards for both men and women. 2.7.2. Strengthen and promote agriculture insurance across the country to increase farmers’ adaptation capacity. 2.7.3. Continue to promote descent settlement targeting the relocation of people from highrisk zones to planned areas including in the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) Models taking into account gender related dimensions. Policy issue 2.8. Despite a range of opportunities offered through regional economic groupings in which Rwanda belongs, men and women, especially those in business through the private sector are still not optimally using and benefiting from these opportunities in terms of free movement of goods, services and capitals as well as use accessing to a bigger market regional market. Policy Actions 2.8.1. Ensure equal access between men and women to cross-border and regional business opportunities 2.8.2. Establish mechanisms for empowerment of women to benefit from regional and continental trade agreements such as the EAC, COMESA and CFTA 2.8.3. Raise awareness of the private sector on economic opportunities available through regional economic grouping to which Rwanda belong. Priority Area 3: Continue to promote gender equality and equity in education, health and social protection sectors Objective 3: Improve the implementation of gender equality and equity principles in education, health and social protection38 Policy issue 3.1: Despite gender parity in education at primary and secondary levels, there remain gender gaps in TVET, STEM and tertiary education. At TVET level, the observed gender gaps are explained by the choice of trades where women and girls are predominantly in soft trades (e.g. tailoring, hair dressing, welding, etc.) with low remuneration while men and boys focus on construction, carpentry, motor mechanics, electricity, etc. with relatively high remuneration. With respect to the choice of STEM subjects, girls are less represented mainly due to traditional beliefs and stereotypes prevailing within the Rwandan society that STEM subjects are meant for boys. With regards to tertiary education, girls are relatively less represented both as students and academic staff and one of the factors is that early marriage and childbearing increases the workload and responsibilities of women, both students and teachers, in universities and institutes. Policy Actions 3.1.1. Bridge the gender divide gap in ICT, STEM, and TVET education programs at all levels of education. 3.1.2. Continue to promote the engendering of teaching curriculums starting from primary, secondary, and tertiary education. 3.1.3. Strengthen the capacity of teachers on gender responsive pedagogy 3.1.4. Engage families in promoting gender responsive education focusing on ICT, STEM, and TVET education programs. 3.1.5. Accelerate the scaling-up of community based Early Childhood Development (ECDs) Centers to ensure a holistic child development process, including child nutrition security and positive parenting. 3.1.6. To link ECD with the E-PW scheme to allow women to take part in productive activities (considering women child caring in ECDs at the site as part of E-PW). Policy issue 3.2: Women, especially those living in rural areas still face challenges in accessing and using modern contraceptive methods of family planning, resulting from unmet needs and negative perceptions about these methods. Policy Actions 3.2.1. Strengthen access and use of modern contraceptive methods of family planning for rural women and men39 3.2.2. Increase awareness of both women and men as well as girls and boys on the benefits of using modern contraceptive methods as far as family planning and reproductive health are concerned. 3.2.3. Reinforce community education by Community Health Workers to promote the continuous use of long lasting and permanent methods of FP services 3.2.4. Strengthen integration of family planning in post-natal care services Policy issue 3.3: Despite efforts in the fighting GBV cases and significant improvement in reporting GBV cases, the situation analysis has revealed a set of issues that need to be addressed by this policy. First, there is still a gap in the reporting of GBV cases which is not comprehensive and male victims feel excluded by current reporting mechanisms. These are designed as if only women are the victims while men have also reported being victims. Second, there is limited participation of men in existing community structures addressing GBV such as Family’s evening - Umugoroba w’Imiryango and Friends of Families (Inshuti z’Umuryango). Third, there is still ineffectiveness in the referral processes coupled with lack of specialized judicial services providers and evidence preservation (actions, see Gender Equality Status report 2018, page 99). Fourth, reintegration of both victims and perpetrators in the society still face problems where there is a weak follow up leading to stigmatization, social exclusion, depression and recidivism mainly for the perpetrators. Policy Actions 3.3.1. Strengthen existing community structures such as Umugoroba w’Imiryango, Inshuti z’Umurynago to prevent and eradicate Gender Based Violence (GBV) and child abuse. These will include capacity enhancement of these structures, provision of incentives to care workers and provision of clear guidelines for the operationalization of these structures 3.3.2. Enhance accountability and access to justice for victims of GBV both men and women, boys and girls 3.3.3. Scale-up access to Isange One Stop Centers comprehensive services (e.g. psychosocial and medical support that can be livered at health centers, etc.) and improve referral mechanisms. 3.3.4. Improve mechanisms to collect, preserve, protect and report GBV evidences. 3.3.5. Put in place effective mechanisms of reintegrating the victims and perpetrators in the community 3.3.6. Put in place a conducive environment that considers gender stereotypes to ensure effective reporting by men when they face issues related to GBV. Policy issue 3.4: Government has made efforts to improve sanitation facilities for girls’ students, especially in primary and secondary schools, such as establishing “Girl’s room” (Icyumba cy’Umukobwa) and separated toilets for boys and girls. However, not all schools have “girl’s room” and meet the required standards to serve effectively and for the purpose they are meant. The lack of these facilities makes some girls skip class, leave school earlier or be distracted while in classroom with negative consequences on their performances. Policy Actions 3.4.1. Scale-up girls’ rooms in both public and private schools and universities and ensure that they are functional and maintained to the required standards. 3.4.2. Enforce strict measures to ensure cleanness of sanitation facilities in all public spaces including schools and universities. Policy issue 3.5: Field consultations and review of existing administrative reports show an increasing trend in teenage pregnancy among girls below the age of 18 years. In addition, there is a gap in sexual and reproductive health education at family level due to cultural norms and practices as well as in schools. Although the curriculum includes components on sexual reproductive health, there is a need to enrich them to change norms and perceptions of the Rwandans towards menstruation. Periods are still perceived as a taboo, and young girls face related challenges especially in schools. Furthermore, teen mother below 18 years are left out in the VUPpublic works because they are below the official public works age and they are neither categorized as children nor considered as women, but rather left out in all programs meant to benefit the vulnerable population. Policy Actions 3.5.1. Increase teenage knowledge about fertility control and gender responsive sexual and reproductive health. 3.5.2. Promote dialogue on sexual and reproductive health at family level 3.5.3. Establish mechanisms against discrimination of teenage mothers and support their social integration. 3.5.4. Enforce restrictions on the use of ICT-based programs attracting teenagers towards unethical sexual practices. 3.5.5. Establish and strengthen Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH) clubs in secondary schools and add more programs in the curriculum according to age for girls to feel comfortable when they reach puberty and so that boys could understand that menstruation is an integral normal part of a female reproductive system. 3.5.6. Enhance youth friendly sexual and reproductive health services in health Centrers and train the staff to employ youth friendly approaches 3.5.7. Reinforce counselling services in “Icyumba cy’umukobwa” at primary and secondary school on adolescents’ sexual and reproductive health Policy issue 3.6: In spite of innovative and home-grown solutions aiming at reducing poverty, especially the social protection programmes such as Girinka and VUP, women and girls remain affected by poverty more than men and boys. In addition, the design and implementation of these programmes is not well informed by comprehensive gender gap analysis limiting consideration of gender dimensions beyond sex disaggregated numbers often reported post interventions. In addition, despite their eligibility many women find their participation in VUP Public Works very limited due to their full involvement in unpaid care work. Policy Actions 3.6.1. Improve the engendering of all social protection programmes based on a comprehensive gender gap analysis during their design to ensure that priority interventions are gender responsive and address identified gender issues beyond mere reporting of sexdisaggregated data. 3.6.2. Accelerate the scaling-up of social protection programmes by promoting innovative approaches for resources mobilization including those led by communities such as “Kuremera” to ensure that all intended beneficiaries are reached out. 3.6.3. Map and address gender issues facing people with disabilities. Priority Area 4: Leverage on positive cultural norms that support best practices for gender promotion Objective 4: Identify, map gender best practices and address persistent cultural norms, gender stereotypes, and imbalances affecting the principles of gender equality and equity between women and men and girls and boys. Policy Issue 4.1: Whereas Rwanda envisions to reinforce the need to leverage on cultural values as foundations for the desired and intended national transformation, there are still some persistent cultural norms, practices, stereotypes perceived by the society as relevant while at the same time compromise gender equality and equity principles. As a result, respect of gender principles remains observed mainly at public spheres and less in the daily lives and practices of the community thus, reflecting little transformation brought by previous efforts for gender promotion. Policy Actions 4.1.1. Identify, map and address persistent negative cultural norms, gender stereotypes and practices affecting the principles of gender equality and equity. 4.1.2. Organize awareness campaigns towards eradication of cultural barriers and practices that hinder full participation of women and girls in socio-economic activities and governance spheres. 4.1.3. Engage men for increased participation in domestic chores to allow women participate more in other productive activities. 4.1.4. Engage men and women in promoting gender responsive education at family level (Uburere mu muryango). Priority area 5: Men and boys’ engagement in gender promotion Objective 5: Ensure effective boys and men’s engagement programs and strategies in gender promotion Policy Issues 5.1. Despite the Government of Rwanda’s high political will, there remains gaps to effectively engage men and boys as key partners in promoting gender equality and equity. Furthermore, men’s resistance resulting from cultural norms, misunderstanding of gender principles and dimensions due to inadequate gender-related education as well as the lack of adequate mechanisms for engaging men and boys, prevent them from playing a central role in gender promotion. Policy Actions 5.1.1. Develop a National Men engage strategy/program to ensure that men and boys are effectively engaged in gender related interventions across sectors, with more focus on the private sector. This may include designing and implementing community awareness raising campaigns and education programs in areas such as nutrition security and sanitation. 5.1.2. Increase the understanding of men and boys to view gender equality and equity not only as a human right but also as a developmental approach that guarantees national inclusive and sustainable socio-economic transformation. 5.1.3. Engage children, girls and boys in gender equality and equity through formal education and at family level. Priority Area 6: Increase women’s meaningful participation and representation in leadership and decision-making positions in public and private sector as well as CSOs at all levels Objective 6: Strengthen the mechanisms for promoting women’s meaningful participation in leadership and decision-making positions in all sectors and at all levels Policy Issue 6.1: Despite the constitutional provision of at least 30% quota for women representation in decision making and leadership positions, there is still low representation of women in local government, private sector, media, CSOs and in security organs. Particularly in the local Government, the gender gaps are still observed for appointed, elected and competitive positions. Furthermore, there is a likely misinterpretation of the above constitutional provision with regard to women’s representation where some institutions see the 30% as the ultimate target, limiting extra-efforts in bridging the gender gaps in women’s representation in leadership and governance. Policy Actions 6.1.1. Mobilize and capacitate women to optimize the opportunities offered by the existing high political level will to participate in leadership and governance including in managerial positions, especially at government decentralized entities, private sector and in Media. 6.1.2. Ensure that the constitutional minimum quota of at least 30% of women representation in decision making and leadership positions is enforced in private sector, CSOs and media. 6.1.3. Address the existing misinterpretation by some institutions treating the constitutional provision of at least 30% quota of women’s representation in decision-making and leadership positions as their ceiling in order to optimize their gender parity potential. 6.1.4. Ensure the voice of women and girls is heard and their participation in the national development process effective. Priority Area 7: Enhance gender specific capacity development Objective 7: Increase knowledge and institutional capacity development on gender equality and equity in public and private sectors, Academia, CSOs, FBOs as well as among citizens in general Policy issue 7.1: Despite commendable efforts by the government and partners in promoting gender equality principles, evidence shows persistent misinterpretation/misunderstanding of gender equality among citizens and operationalization of its principles calling for more gender specific capacity development. Policy Action 7.1.1. Enhance and streamline the existing mechanisms for awareness raising for gender equity by different actors at all levels. 7.1.2. Conduct capacity building on key gender related concepts and principles such as gender equality, gender gap analysis, gender mainstreaming, gender accountability and the “crosscutting nature” of gender across sectors at all levels. 7.1.3. Establish gender capacity building programs targeting different players, including policy makers, parliamentarians, business communities, CSOs, FBOs, Academia, etc; in partnership with RDB, where the national capacity building program is domiciled. Policy issue 7.2: Cognizant of particular roles played by each member of the gender machinery, there remains gaps in the institutional arrangements to effectively respond to the core mandatory roles including national coordination, implementation and accountability on GEWE. In addition, the structure at local government level does not provide a good ground for gender gap analysis. For instance, gender and family officers are placed in the governance unit and hence play limited role in the districts’ planning process to ensure gender responsive programing. At central level, not all ministries and agencies have gender focal point /specialist to ensure effective gender mainstreaming across sectors. Policy Actions 7.2.1. Strengthen the coordination and streamline the existing capacity development programs on gender by different stakeholders. 7.2.2. Enhance institutional capacity to promote the use of gender profile and gender related statistics mainly generated by NISR and GMO to inform the planning and production of regular gender status reports. 7.2.3. Explore the possibility to reallocate the District gender and family officers from governance unit to planning unit to ensure proper gender mainstreaming and accountability at District level. Priority Area 8: Conducive Legal Framework for gender equality Objective 8: Guarantee a conducive legal framework that takes into account Rwanda’s sociocultural context especially focusing on property rights for women in informal unions Policy issue 8.1: Despite continuous sensitization and existing legal provisions that discourage informal unions and the precarious situation under which women in such unions live the number of couples engaged in such relationships continue to rise. Most recent figures from EICV 5 indicate a big percentage of couples living in informal unions equaling to 34 % at country level. In some districts, the figures are alarming representing up to 49.9% in Nyarugenge and 52.1% in Nyagatare standing for more than half of all married couples. Though a lot has been done to ensure matrimonial property rights of all citizens, the legal framework has so far proved insufficient to effectively ensure secure rights for women living in informal unions. All the existing laws and policies corroborate with Article 17 of the Rwandan Constitution of 2015 that recognizes only civil monogamous marriage between a man and a woman as the only parties to this marriage with equal rights and duties during the subsistence of a marriage and at the time of divorce. The only legal provision that mentions the category of informal unions is Article 39 of GBV Law on “Legalizing unlawful marriages and common assets distribution”. Until now such provision (article 39) has been proved insufficient to effectively ensure secure property rights for all women living in informal monogamous. Policy actions 8.1.1. Elaboration of new laws and review of existing ones in regard to informal unions taking into account Rwanda’s socio-cultural context. 8.1.2. Continue sensitization on the benefits of registration marriages as the best options of spousal relationships and on changing mind set around social cultural factors such the pressure from the society and the family requesting girls to get married leaving them with limited choice of whom to marry. 8.1.3. Revise and make effective Article 39 of GBV Law on “Legalizing unlawful marriages and common assets distribution” by availing the related long-awaited Ministerial Order by Ministry of Local Government or another specific legal provision. 8.1.4. Review the definition of such informal unions/marriages from unlawful as stated in most of the existing legal framework to informal; consensual or de-facto unions. 8.1.5. Explore the option of establishing a certain period of time upon which couples cohabiting in informal monogamous unions might be officially recognized as formally married considering the pull factors that are mainly beyond the control of women and girls, and the resistance of men in informal unions to formalize their unions. Box 1: A glance of key messages under this gender policy This policy proposes a number of new changes and areas to focus on during its implementation as compared to the previous policy and taking into account new emerging dynamics in the gender sector. Policy orientation: this policy’s orientation is to ensure that gender mainstreaming and accountability become more effective towards a transformative gender promotion in Rwanda. Institutional arrangement: from the current institutional arrangement of the gender sector, it is proposed to have gender focal persons with required specific skills on gender in all sectors and hence implementing agencies. Secondly, the gender officers at district levels need to be allocated in the planning unit to ensure that gender is well mainstreamed in the planning of all sectors and district level program implementation. Furthermore, there is also possibility to have a policy analyst at the Office of the Prime Minister who solely focus on gender related matters to ensure effective gender mainstreaming and accountability in all policy related documents. Finally, but not least, GMO should enforce its capacity of gender monitoring but also exercise further its power of gender accountability. Process of implementation: the implementation of this gender policy should be guided by gender gap analysis that informs real gender issues, provides a good knowledge of the gender gaps in every sector, leading not only to gender sensitive but also gender responsive interventions across-sectors. The policy proposes further a shift in the understanding of gender concept and make this well contextualized at sector level based on specific sector gender gap analysis and gender mainstreaming strategies. This has to be done based on guidelines to be provided by the gender machinery as headed by the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion. More enforcement is also needed to ensure inter-sectorial collaboration which simply justifies the cross-cutting nature of gender among others. Gender Responsive M&E and Accountability: based on the definition of key priority areas, a gender responsive M&E framework is needed at all levels and for all sectors. There is need to enforce the M&E capacity in each implementing entity for an effective gender performance tracking system. With respect to gender accountability, it is proposed to have this as part of the on-going Imihigo performance contracts in public and private sectors by assigning a certain percentage share to gender responsive performance indicators in the overall score of Imihigo evaluation. Comprehensive gender related capacity development: cognizant of the observed gaps in gender related capacity (both individual and institutional), the policy proposes a comprehensive capacity development program on gender to help in obtaining gender specific skills needed at all levels and for all sectors. 6. Institutional Framework The implementation of the policy actions and provisions in the national gender policy will call for an effective collaboration and coordination of the members of the gender machinery and other government entities at the central level while the implementation of the policy actions will need to be done at community level through District leadership. Furthermore, apart from the gender machinery and government entities, the civil society and development partners will also contribute to the successful implementation, other Ministries from the central government will also contribute to the implementation of the policy actions across sectors. 6.1. Central Level All the ministries are concerned by the policy actions proposed under the first priority area with regards to the engendering of the national sector policies, planning frameworks, and strategies in public and private sectors. Particularly to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN), the Ministry will continue to ensure that proper guidelines on gender sensitive and responsive programs across sectors in the planning process are available and streamlined for advanced awareness and capacity development of planning and budget entities on effective gender mainstreaming. Furthermore, the National Institute of Statistics (NISR) will continue to support all sectors especially the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF) and GMO in generation of gender related data and statistics to inform the planning and implementation of gender responsive programs, the gender profiling across sectors, and regular and mandatory gender status related reports. In addition, from the policy analysis and advisory point of view, to avoid that gender related aspects are compounded or overlooked among other development concerns; it may be more effective if a specific policy analyst at GACU, Office of the Prime Minister is assigned sole responsibilities related to gender mainstreaming across sectors. 6.1. The National Gender Machinery The machinery composed of MIGEPROF, GMO, NWC, FFRP will, among other roles, enhance its capacity in ensuring that policy options proposed in this policy are effectively implemented. The machinery will have to identify and avail all gender related technical support needed by sectors in gender mainstreaming and gender accountability. 6.2. Local Government During the implementation of this policy, the local government or the districts will be responsible for the adaptation of their respective District Development Strategies and Annual Action Plans to ensure that the policy prescriptions provided across the various priority areas are well accommodated, implemented, and benefit the community participation and compliance where necessary. 6.3. The Private Sector Throughout the implementation of this gender policy, the role of the private sector is critical in ensuring that the gender parity gaps in the private sub-sectors is reduced, women’s active participation in highly and well-paying business activities and enterprises, financial inclusion for women is strengthened, and well-paying trades. Moreover, the financial sector will continue to ensure that women access financial products meant to improve their financial inclusion and capacity for investment. 6.4. Development Partners Through direct or indirect mechanisms of development support, development partners will continue to support the government and other partners involved in gender promotion in various sub-programs across sectors. However, a well streamlined and coordinated support both at institutional and sector level is likely to improve the effects of the financing of gender promotion. 6.5. Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), NGOs and Media The implementation of this policy will involve more demand for resources to implement the various policy actions including capacity development on gender and other gender responsive interventions. CSOs, NGOs and media will support the implementation of this policy at different levels, mobilize communities on gender equality, and advocacy for constructive policy engagement on gender promotion among others. 6.6. The Academia and Research Institutions Gender is increasingly becoming a science that requires a lot of and multidisciplinary approach for education and research. Academic and research institutions will contribute to the gender analysis, documentation of gender related best practices, and gender research in general to inform the policy plans and program implementation in this particular area. 7. Gender Policy Implications Various policy implications are expected once this policy is successfully implemented. These are related to economic, financial, legal, and social related implications. 7.1. Economic Implications This gender policy will increase the economic empowerment of women which in turn will translate into other economic benefits. Enabling conditions to be created by this policy comprise increased productive capacity of women and men through equal access and control of productive assets and resources such as land; access to financial services and products for investment; increased participation of women in entrepreneurship and business development, and active involvement in various components of the agricultural value chain. Therefore, possible economic impacts resulting from the policy actions proposed in the above regards include increased greater productivity and income of women from employment in decent, non-traditional, and highly productive economic sectors. Secondly, it is expected to have more financial inclusion especially for women resulting from more financial literacy and access to financial services and products meant to bridge the gender parity gaps in entrepreneurship, business development and investment in various sectors of the economy. 7.2. Financial Implications This gender policy will have financial implications in terms of additional financial resources required to implement the various policy actions and activities therein. A better understanding of the nature of gender responsive interventions implies a further definition of additional programs and sub-programs meant to address gender equality gaps observed across sectors. Thus, the finding from government and development partners will need to increase to finance new programs and projects aimed to promote gender and women’s economic empowerment. 7.1. Legal Implications The government and especially the parliament will ensure that affirmative actions in the procurement policy and law are introduced to enable women and girls participate in bigger and remunerative public procurement projects. Another legal implication of this policy is the enforcement of non-discriminative laws and other gender related legal instruments with focus to the discrimination against teen mothers to ensure their social integration. Finally, the policy envisages some restrictions on the use of ICT-based programs attracting teenagers towards unethical sexual practices; leading to issuance of legal innovation without compromising the benefits of ICT on economic development. 7.4 Social Implications With respect to social related policy implications, the implementation of the policy actions proposed in this gender policy is likely to improve people’s livelihoods due to gender equality in social transformation with focus to education, health, and social protection sectors. Secondly, household level conflicts and GBV resulting from the differentials in gender roles will be reduced and hence promoting sustainable peace and sustaining national transformation. In addition, the participation of girls in STEM will be increased, leading to more decent jobs and occupation for women in the future rather than relying on traditional jobs with limited remuneration.
