        "language": "I. Background",
        "prompt":"Volunteering and Volunteerism are strongly embedded in the Rwandan culture. Volunteerism in Rwanda’s tradition featured through self-help and mutual aid activities as well as caring for the weak and rendering community service. The main motivation behind volunteerism in Rwanda is to alleviate socio-economic constraints experienced by individuals or their communities and improve their quality of life. Rwandans relied heavily on volunteerism through mutual help activities such as “ubudehe” and “umuganda” or “umusanzu” which involved several families getting together to work together on projects like communal farming, crop harvesting, and construction of shelter and thatching as well as maintenance of public infrastructure and management of the environment. \nThe volunteer culture in the Rwandan society was natured and fostered by the institution called “itorero” which trained and inculcated in the minds of Rwandans of all ages a set of values – “indangagaciro” and preached against taboos and vices – “kirazira” which provided benchmarks for the value system upon which the Rwanda Society is founded. It is through itorero that the culture of serving the country with a high sense of patriotism, responsibility, selflessness and volunteerism was inculcated among the Rwandans. \nThe spirit of volunteerism transcended the Rwandan social structure and was relied upon by the national leadership institutions operating under the king as an effective tool of mobilizing people for national and community service activities including among others; security, disaster relief and other social economic community services. The volunteerism spirit was used at all levels among Rwandans to address issues confronting society at various levels."

        "language": "1.1. The concept of Volunteerism",
        "prompt":"The International Labor Organization (ILO) proposes the following working definition of volunteerism. “unpaid non-compulsory work, that is, time that individuals give without pay to activities performed either through an organization of directly for others outside their own household.” Therefore the key elements to be considered according to the ILO definition are: work, unpaid, non-compulsory or non-obligatory work, work not done for family members. \nThe definition of volunteerism is strongly influenced by the history, politics, religion and culture of a community. What might be seen as volunteering in one country might be dismissed as low paid or labor intensive in another. However what is important is to ensure that all necessary elements that qualify a certain activity to be voluntary are present."
    },
 {
        "language": "1.2. Volunteerism in the Rwandan context",
        "prompt":"The term Volunteerism in the Rwandan context, is referred to as: “ubwitange”, which literally means a “free will action”, performed out of self-motivation and passion. Ubwitange includes, amongst others, volunteering activities such as umuganda, gutanga umusanzu, guheka abarwayi (providing ambulance services to sick members of the community). \n \nAccording to the adopted Itorero strategy, Volunteerism is defined as: “the practice of \npeople working for a particular cause without payment for their time and services. It is \nthe desire to undertake by choice and free will a task or work for the benefit of the \nwider community beyond the volunteer’s immediate family and friends” \nVolunteerism in Rwanda is exhibited through provision of services to the community \nsuch as Umuganda, Ubudehe, Umusanzu (Communal self-help activities based on solidarity), \nAbunzi, local government councils (Njyanama), Gacaca judges, electoral commission \nagents, community health workers (abajyanama b’ubuzima), traditional birth \nattendants etc., that do not involve any salary payment in return and done out of free \nwill for the purpose of benefiting the whole community. \n \nVolunteerism is manifested by carrying out activities especially in the framework of volunteer-involving organizations without expecting payment for the service rendered. This is normally executed through civil society organizations, faith based organizations, nongovernmental organizations, international organizations, public and corporate companies. \n \nTo sum up, based on the criteria mentioned above and taking into account the specificity of the Rwandan context, a volunteer activity in Rwanda, is defined as: \n \nA Self-motivated action, performed by an individual or a group of individuals who contribute their time, skills, advice, talents and passion to the provision of services for the benefit of the larger community, without expecting a salary. The volunteers might however be entitled to stipends intended to cover some of the expenses incurred for the accomplishment of the volunteering activity."

 {
        "language": "1.3. Preferred Option in the Rwandan Context",
        "prompt":"Based on the concept of Ubwitange (National Service) that was used by Rwandans in rebuilding and developing pre-colonial Rwanda, the preferred option to guide our volunteer activities is National Service. Opting for National Service is mainly due to the following principal reasons: \n(i) Rwandans in pre-colonial Rwanda applied National Service in state rebuilding and led the Country to great achievements hence need to be re-adopted; \n(ii) National service is carried out by nationals and non-nationals without expecting any pay for the work accomplished unlike Volunteerism where the Volunteer expects some little pay for the work done; \n(iii) Nationals and non-nationals engaged in National Service activities may later participate in Volunteerism activities as a recognition of their dedicated and committed services to their State;"

        "language": "2. Rationale for establishing a volunteerism policy in Rwanda",
        "prompt":"nThe government of Rwanda has used the volunteerism mechanism in various sectors especially in local government, the judiciary, health sector etc to achieve developmental goals. It is against this background that success stories have been registered in instances where volunteerism has been used. For example according to the study conducted by the Center of Conflict Management, of the National University of Rwanda, Gacaca was rated at 87% satisfaction rate on the process and outcome. Today the number of volunteers used nationwide to achieve developmental goals by far supersede that of salaried employees. \n \nFrom the above experiences and lessons Rwanda has adopted national service based on a blended model (voluntary and compulsory). The target group for the compulsory category is youth between the ages of 18 – 35 years completing their secondary education. Other categories of the population will be allowed to participant on a voluntary basis depending on their time, professional background and identified priorities. \n \nDespite the fact that there are voluntary interventions in various sectors which Rwandan government has used volunteerism in such sectors like local governance, justice, health and electoral processes, there has been no harmonized and coordinated framework for managing the volunteers. \n \nThis Policy is aimed at providing guidance on the management, rights, responsibilities and roles for both the volunteers and the volunteering organizations. In a more concrete sense the rationale of the policy is to: \n \na) Educate Rwandans the culture of volunteerism through activities of national development \nb) Provide a framework where people are able to make effective use of their special skills and access untapped potential which is an additional contribution to national development \nc) Build pride among volunteers for their role in volunteer work for increasing national production skills development associated with the volunteering activities. \nd) Provide an appropriate institutional framework for effective management, coordination and use of existing and future volunteer activities and resources. \ne) Provide a mechanism through which volunteer services can be recorded and accorded national recognition."
