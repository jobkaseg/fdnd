Introduction\n\nRwanda\u2019s Vision 2050 articulates the long-term strategic direction for \u201cthe Rwanda we want\u201d and the enabling pathways to achieve this ambition. Energized by \u2013 but by no means content with \u2013 the past two decades of success in reducing poverty, increasing incomes, improving living standards, strengthening good governance, promoting home grown solutions, establishing rule of law, maintaining stability, promoting gender equality and women empowerment, peace and security. Rwanda now aspires to transform its economy and modernize the lives of all Rwandans.\n\nRecognizing that achieving these aspirations will require bold and decisive action, Vision 2050 serves as the critical planning and policy blueprint to guide the efforts of all players in Rwanda\u2019s development, including Government, private sector, citizens, diaspora, civil society and faith-based organizations, development partners, academia and research institutions, and political parties.\n\n\n2.Rwanda\u2019s changing development context\n\nRwanda has undergone several development phases starting from the aftermath of the Genocide against the Tutsi in 1994 which focused much on recovery": null, " the early 2000s where the Vision 2020 was elaborated, and gave a blueprint for a new Rwanda embarking on economic development aspirations and post-2010 a period that intensified efforts to lay foundations for sustained growth through investing in human capital, developing basic infrastructure and expanding access to various services.\n\nThe next phase of Rwanda\u2019s long term development is focused on transformation of the entire economy and society. There is a need to continue the journey towards self-reliance through a private sector led growth and transformation economic model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 5\nIn the next 3 decades, the country will make long-term investments in future endowments: enhanced human capabilities, strong innovation and technological\tcapabilities, socioeconomically integrated forms of urbanization, and effective and accountable institutions of governance.\n\nThe country will play to its inherent strengths, which arise from an endowment of labor including a youthful population, a fertile agricultural landscape, natural resources and a good foundation of ICT.\n\n3. Development of Vision 2050\n\nThe Vision 2050 was requested by the 13th National Umushyikirano Council in 2015. Subsequently, broad stakeholder consultations and citizens\u2019 engagement were conducted to define what the Rwanda citizens want to see by 2050.\n\nSpecific stakeholders consulted include: youth and women, private sector, development partners, political parties, civil society, faith-based organizations, academia, and research institutions and persons with disabilities among others.\n\nVision 2050 establishes the development framework for 2020-2050, with a mid-term review envisaged in 2035 and regular reviews planned every 5 years. The Vision intensifies the country\u2019s ambitions and continues the drive towards self-reliance and competitiveness.\n\nThe elaboration of Vision 2050 has taken into consideration the global and regional development agendas, to ensure harmonization of targets and indicators. Those include: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), African Union (AU) Agenda 2063, East African Community (EAC) Vision 2050, and the Paris Agreement on climate change among other instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 6\nTHE RWANDA WE WANT: PROSPERITY AND HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL RWANDANS\n\n\nThe overarching goals for the Vision 2050 are:\n\n1. Economic Growth and Prosperity\n\nRwanda aspires to become an upper-middle income country (UMIC) by 2035, and a high-income country (HIC) by 2050.\n\nSpecifically, this means realizing the following key economic targets:\n\n\u2022 By 2035: GDP per capita of over USD 4,036": null, " and \u2022 By 2050: GDP per capita of over USD 12,476\n\n\n2.High Quality and Standards of Life for Rwandans\n\n\u2022 The aim is to achieve high quality and standards of living.\n\n\u2022 Rwanda will build on the strong progress made in reducing poverty over the last two decades, reducing the poverty rate from 78% after 1994 to 38% in 2017, with the aim of eliminating poverty altogether.\n\n\u2022 This will be achieved through ensuring all walks of society have increased opportunities to contribute to national development, including by growing investments in human capital and ensuring universal access to amenities, safety and security.\n\n\u2022 All youth, women, men, and elderly people will contribute as actors of sustainable development, ensuring that no one is left behind in benefting from development.\n\n\u2022 Vision 2050 is informed by the aspiration of Rwandans of leaving to Rwandan children a better world to live in.\n\n\u2022 As such, growth and development will follow a sustainable path in terms of use and management of natural resources while building resilience to cope with climate change impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 7\n\u2022 Rwandans aspiration for high quality of life will be further appreciated through the quality of the environment, both natural and built.\n\n\u2022 These aspirations will continue to be embedded in Rwanda\u2019s long term Green Growth and Climate Resilient Strategy (GGCRS) whose impact is intended to bring about mindset and developmental transformation in Rwandan society that is necessary to achieve the desired carbon-neutral and climate resilient economy.\n\n\u2022 Efficient use of land across sectors will be guided by the National Land Use and Development Master Plan (2020-2050).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 8\nPILLARS OF THE VISION 2050\n\n\n1. Human Development\n\nThe overarching objective for this pillar is to reap the economic benefits from the estimated \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat is by 2050, the share of the working age population is expected to grow from around 61% of the population in 2017 (NISR) to 65.7% in 2050.\n\nReaping economic benefits from this \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d will be realized only through an integrated approach that ensures that decline in fertility is backed up by essential investments in human capital development and economic reforms so that the country has a healthy, well educated, and highly skilled labor force that is gainfully employed.\n\nSpecific priorities in this pillar include": null, "\n\n\u2022 Universal access to high quality health care\n\n\u2022 Universal access to high quality education\n\n\u2022 A transformed workforce for higher productivity\n\n\n\n2.Competitiveness and Integration\n\nRwanda\u2019s ambition to become a developed country hinges on its ability to enhance competitiveness at macro and micro levels.\n\n\nRwanda is targeting to": null, "\n\n\u2022 Belong to the top 10 countries in doing business in 2035 and maintain the status \u2022 Rank among the top 20 economies in competitiveness by 2035 and top 10 in 2050\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 9\nSpecific priorities under this pillar include": null, "\n\n\u2022 A diversified economy built upon future industries\n\n\u2022 Competitive manufacturing anchored to a regional logistics hub\n\n\u2022 Modern and innovative services sectors driving transformative growth\n\n\u2022 Export-oriented knowledge services\n\n\u2022 High-end sustainable tourism\n\n\u2022 Universal access to financial services\n\n\u2022 Strengthening export competitiveness and trade connectivity\n\n\u2022 Knowledge intensive economy through": null, "\n\n\n\u00bb Fostering excellence in Research and Development (R&D)\n\n\u00bb Remaining a proof-of-concept destination for current and future innovations\n\n\u00bb Becoming a data-driven economy\n\n\u00bb Future-proofing the education system\n\n\n\n3. Agriculture for Wealth Creation\n\n\nThe overarching objective for this pillar is to attain agriculture transformation that is equally led by both women and men professional farmers and commercialized value chains.\n\n\nSpecific priorities under this pillar include": null, "\n\n\n\u2022 Modern market-oriented and climate resilient agriculture\n\n\u2022 Scaled up use of modern inputs and technologies to maximize productivity\n\n\u2022 Increased access to agriculture finance and risk sharing facilities\n\n\u2022 Integration within global value chains for higher-value products\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 10\n4.Urbanization and Agglomeration\n\n\nAs one of the future drivers of the country\u2019s growth, the overarching objective is to have 70% of the population living in urban areas by 2050.\n\n\nBy 2050, Rwanda will have a formal housing sector sufficiently available and accessible to all segments of the population.\n\nIn this pursuit,\tthe new focus under this pillar will be on identifying and creating synergies between the critical elements of urbanization that create agglomeration and enhance the socioeconomic benefits of urbanization.\n\nUrbanization will continue to rapidly change with new growth poles projected to emerge besides the already planned six secondary cities and Kigali city due to large investments being undertaken for example in Bugesera.\n\nRural settlements will grow in a clustered and densified way with the necessary basic infrastructure, services and facilities. Rural households settled in integrated planned settlements will increase from 67.2% (EICV5 2016/17) to 80% by 2024 and 100% by 2035. This will be maintained throughout 2050.\n\n\nKey considerations in the future under this pillar include": null, "\n\n\u2022 Universal access to quality services and amenities\n\n\u2022 Universal access to affordable and decent housing\n\n\u2022 Ease of mobility and efficient transport\n\n\u2022 Smart and Green cities for sustainable growth\n\n\u2022 Sustainable supply and demand for energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 11\n5.Accountable and Capable State Institutions\n\n\nThe overarching objective for this pillar is to consolidate gains made and continue\n\ncitizen-centred reforms in local innovations and home grown solutions into the next\n\nphase of long-term development.\n\n\n\nGovernance and effective institutions constitute a key pillar of socioeconomic transformation\n\nof Rwanda. They are prerequisites to achieve the national agenda in all sectors.\n\n\nTo fulfill the Vision 2050 aspirations, Rwanda\u2019s institutions and governance will need to\n\nbecome modern, innovative, accountable to citizens, and rooted in the rule of law.\n\nSpecific priorities under this pillar include": null, "\n\n\n\u2022 Ensuring efficient and accountable institutions for socioeconomic transformation\n\n\u2022 Deepening decentralization to bring services closer to the citizens\n\n\u2022 Rule of law and justice for all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 12\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\u2022 For Vision 2050 to be successful, a set of prerequisites need to be fulfilled to ensure transformation and growth. These include": null, "\n\n\u00bb Consistency in prioritization\n\u00bb Increasing the role of private sector \u00bb Deepening regional integration\n\n\u00bb Adopting an unconventional approach: \u201cBusiness-as-usual\u201d is not sufficient to reach the objectives of Vision 2050.\n\n\n\u2022 The aspirations in this Vision will not be reached without hard work. The requirements that must be in place to achieve the Vision 2050 objectives are enshrined in three main elements:\n\n\u00bb Strong and sustainable macroeconomic fundamentals \u00bb Positive values for societal transformation\n\u00bb A rigorous and effective monitoring and implementation framework.\n\n\nThese are further elaborated below": null, "\n\n\n\n1. Strong and Sustainable macroeconomic fundamentals\n\n\u2022 Rwanda aims to reach upper middle-income status in 2035 and high-income status in 2050.\n\n\u2022 To reach these targets, the needed GDP growth rates (annual average) are at least 12% during 2018-2035 and 10% from 2036 to 2050.\n\nTo achieve this aspiration, Rwanda will need to": null, "\n\n\u25ca Attract and sustain high private investment\n\u25ca Increase domestic savings and capital inflows \u25ca Promote higher public investment\n\u25ca Improve human capital through education\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 13\n2. Positive Values supporting Societal Transformation\n\n\nPost-genocide against the Tutsi, Rwanda\u2019s starting point was rebuilding institutions\n\nand ensuring security of all Rwandans. Although everything was priority after the 1994\n\nGenocide against the Tutsi, Rwanda made a \u201ctriple choice,\u201d (staying together, being\n\naccountable and thinking big) highlighting the way of doing business unusually1.\n\n\nFurther, Rwanda recognizes the importance of her culture and values in providing a\n\nplatform for sustained socioeconomic transformation and prosperity.\n\n\nThis will involve sustaining shared positive values for 2050. These will be cultivated and\n\nsustained to provide the right impetus and framework for delivering the aspirations of\n\nthis Vision.\n\nThese values include": null, "\n\n\u2022 Self-determination, including self-suficiency as a Nation (Kwigira), Solidarity and Dignity (Agaciro)\n\n\u2022 Unity and reconciliation and the Rwandan Identity/culture\n\n\u2022 Equity (including gender), and Inclusiveness\n\n\u2022 Citizen-centred governance\n\n\u2022 Rwanda\u2019s Home-grown Solutions: These include Girinka and Ubudehe, Imihigo, Umuganda,\n\nCommunity Health Workers (CHWs), Universal Health Insurance, Gacaca courts, National\n\nUmushyikirano council, Abunzi and Access to Justice Bureaus.\n\n\nThese and other Home Grown Solutions (HGS) will remain at the heart of Rwanda\u2019s socio-economic development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\u201cSpeech of HE Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda in the commemoration of 20th Anniversary of Genocide against the Tutsi, April 2014\u201d\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 14\n3. Rigorous and Effective monitoring and implementation framework\n\n\u2022 Vision 2050 encompasses two distinct time periods, 2020-2035 and 2036-2050, with a mid-period review point during each phase to allow for readjusting plans and targets as necessary.\n\n\u2022 A mechanism for regular assessment of progress achieved and alignment of the Vision to take into account Rwanda\u2019s changing development context will be implemented.\n\n\u2022 The implementation of Vision 2050 will be done through medium-term development strategies starting from the first National Strategy for Transformation (NST 1) which serves to bridge the Vision 2020 and Vision 2050.\n\n\u2022 Vision 2050 planning and execution will be driven by existing development planning and implementation frameworks at the national, sector, and district level, respectively as indicated in the Figure 1": null, "\n\nFigure 1: The Development Planning Framework for Vision 2050\n\n\nVision 2050 Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs),\nAfrican Union (AU) Agenda 2063, EAC Vision 2050\n\n\n\nNational Strategy\nfor Transformation (NST)\n\n\n\n\n\nSector Strategic Plans/SSPs (Covering Speci\ufb01c areas e.g. Health, Education)\n\nDistrict Development Strategies (Considering District /CoK Speci\ufb01cities)\n\n\n\n\nMTEF, Annual Plans and Budgets, Imihigo, M&E\n\n\n\nVISION 2050 | 15\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\u2022 Building on Rwanda\u2019s extraordinary record of success and energized by the aspirations of a strong leadership and a middle class on the rise, Vision 2050 charts a bold and ambitious future for Rwanda.\n\n\u2022 Rwanda\u2019s ambitious economic objectives can only be achieved through structural transformation. Rwanda\u2019s aspirations are emboldened by the window of opportunity over the medium term to increase employment in manufacturing and services, for greater regional and international integration, and to leverage the demographic dividend.\n\n\u2022 Vision 2050 endeavours to chart this course, recognizing that challenges and opportunities will present themselves over the course of this Vision\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u2022 Rwanda aspires to provide increased incomes, high-quality livelihoods, and modern living standards to all Rwanda\u2019s citizens. Rwanda aspires to be a modern, innovative, equitable, accountable society with comprehensive utilities, clean water, easy mobility, and equal access to quality healthcare, education, and job opportunities for all its citizens.\n\n\u2022 The education system will be market-led to match Rwandans\u2019 skills with the modern industries and services that drive the economy. These objectives will be built upon a foundation of strong macroeconomic fundamentals and effective institutions supported by positive values and leveraging on home grown solutions.\n\n\u2022 Rwanda\u2019s leadership and citizens alike, recognize that achieving these aspirational goals in the Vision 2050 will not be easy. The agenda will be challenging, requiring intense improvements in productivity, prioritization of investments, and an unconventional mind-set. Learning from international experience, countries have achieved the sustained growth rates required by Vision 2050.\n\n\u2022 Nevertheless, through Vision 2050 Rwanda continues to set itself a uniquely high level of ambition. Current and future generations of Rwandans have the spirit, self-determination and solidarity to implement the aspirations of Vision 2050 successfully and to move toward a transformed economy and way of life over the coming decades.\n\nVISION 2050 | 16\nVISION 2050 INDICATORS MATRIX\n\n\nObjective\n\n\n\nQuality well-being\n\n\nInclusive accelerated economic growth\n\n\nEmployment
