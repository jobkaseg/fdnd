Explanation:

What is a letter of intent?

A letter of intent is a document an organization can use to declare its preliminary commitment to do business with another party. Companies typically use a letter of intent in acquisitions and mergers to identify and track the preliminary terms of an agreement. Although this document is typically nonbinding, it can help both parties record the primary terms that two parties agree upon before conducting business together.

What is a memorandum of understanding?

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is an agreement between two or more individuals or organizations that summarizes an understanding between all parties involved and describes each party's contributions and responsibilities. This is typically the first step toward creating a formal contract, where all parties agree to uphold their element of an understanding.
