Governance In the National Strategy for transformation, (NST1) Rwanda has committed to consolidating good governance and justice as building blocks for equitable and sustainable national development. In this Respect, RGB broad has the RGB responsibilities of promoting democracy and advising the government and administrative organs on policies, laws and strategies to ensure compliance with the fundamental principles of good governance. RGB also has the mission of putting in place strategies for enhancing citizens' participation as well as advising the government on the implementation of decentralisation and capacity development policy. Programs To deliver on its mandate related to governance, RGB has rolled out he following programs: Imiyoborere Twifuza, Umuturage ku Isonga (The Governance We Want) The program aims at promoting the principles of good governance in all institutions and among the general population to achieve ‘The Rwanda we want.’ These principles include; transparency, improved service delivery, fighting corruption, fighting forms of injustice and citizens participation in policy and decisionmaking. This program involves different activities including citizens’ engagements through campaigns, workshops, addressing citizen’s complaints, enhancing the implementation of the programs geared to eradicate poverty and service delivery monitoring in private and public institutions. This program has been brought much closer to the population for effectiveness and ownership. Umurenge Kagame Cup The competition started in 2006 under the name “Good Governance Competition”. In 2010, the competition changed to Umurenge Kagame Cup to recognize the role of H.E President Paul Kagame, for his relentless commitment to promote Good Governance in Rwanda and his tremendous support to sports promotion. The competition involves multidisciplinary sports for all categories including men, women and people with disabilities. The main objective is to engage the youth to show-case their ability and skills. It also provides an environment for entertainment and leisure as a tool to mobilize the youth to participate in different government programs, encouraging them to work and avoid bad behaviors such as drug abuse and other illicit practices. Read Instructions governing Umurenge Kagame Cup Competition Peer-Learning Peer Review Program (PL-PR) It is a governance innovation introduced by the government of Rwanda to enhance accountability in nonbudget local government entities. This program is implemaented through peer audits and inspections among concerned organs in the District. The Peer Learning Peer Review program covers four elements namely`; general environment, social protection, public finance management and service delivery. Read Full Peer-Learning Peer Review Program Instructions Governance assessment Governance assessment involves monitoring and evaluation of existing mechanisms, programs and policies in order to assess their performance in relation of complying with good governance principles. The assessment generate reports that show existing gaps and draw recommendations to inform policies or suggest improvement in existing programs. Capacity building Capacity building is done with the aim of equipping institutions and personnel with the required skills and capabilities to abide by good governance principles in their daily work. Coaching The coaching program focuses on supporting districts in improving their performance through support in improving strategic planning and service delivery; monitoring and evaluation. To enable a better coordination of the program at local level, the coaching program is managed at provincial and the City of Kigali levels and coordinated by RGB. Service Delivery Rwanda envisions to achieve 90% of citizens satisfaction with service delivery and 100% of all public services delivered online by 2024. RGB is responsible to regularly monitor the status of service delivery across sectors to assess the progress towards achieving national targets. RGB also has the powers to hold public and private institutions accountable and to request for administrative sanctions against defaulting institutions or staff members. Activities and programs To promote quality service delivery, RGB has put in place programs and regulary implements the following activities: NK’uwikorera The essence of Nk’uwikorera campaign is all about institutional performance and effective service delivery to citizens. It encourages the ideals of quality service, as one would like to receive. Conceptually, it is an imperative to meet in order to spur inclusive growth and boost productivity in across of all sectors. Nk’uwikorera is built on the foundation of people-centered governance policy pursued by the Government of Rwanda. It is geared towards the effectiveness of institutions at all levels: central government, local government, private sector, the civil society and faith based organisations, for the betterment of the people. Launched in 2017, Nk’uwikorera is a service delivery campaign mainly meant for behaviour change. The campaign name reflects the attitude and behaviour to promote quality service delivery both from service providers and service recipients. Thus,“Nk’uwikorera” translated as “as you would wish to be served” intends to instil within Rwandan citizens the attitude of considering service delivery as the pillar of individual and national development. To encourage the service providers to put themselves in the shoes of service seekers in order to weigh their expectations and serve them accordingly. To service recipient, this program intends to call them to denounce poor service delivery wherever it’s observed, not only for individual interest, but also as a contribution to the society and to national development. Service delivery Standards RGB in collaboration with stakeholders developed a set of minimum standards to guide institutions on measures to improve the quality of service. Based on the nature of services, institutions/sectors may develop standards that are specific. These standards are mainly intended to achieve the following objectives: • To enhance the culture of service excellence • To facilitate self-assessment at institutional level • To enhance professionalism in service delivery • To promote the use of technology in Service Delivery; • To enable coordination, monitoring and evaluation of service delivery; • To reduce corruption tendencies; • To set a systematic approach to deliver to quality service. Service delivery assessments Every year, RGB conducts service delivery assessments in public and private sector institutions in order to measures institutional performance against service standards and national service delivery related goals. Service delivery assessments are also carried out in specific sectors to identify critical issues that need to be addressed and to generate policy recommendations for enhancing performance of sectors and ensure effective implementation of government programs. Joint Action Development Forum-JADF The Joint Action Development Forum (JADF) is a multi-stakeholder platform comprised of representatives from the public sector, private sector and civil society. It was put in place to facilitate and promote full participation of citizens in the decentralized and participatory governance and improve service provision processes. RGB is mandated to and coordinate and follow up the Joint Action Development Forum activities. THE FUNCTIONING OF JADF JADF members come from institutions and organisations operating at District level including public, private, local and international NGOs, Faith-based organisations and other development partners. JADF serves as a non-hierarchical discussion platform in which every member has equal role to play: representing their constituency, provide open, complete and transparent information about their development activities and results, discuss progress made in the District towards sustainable and inclusive local development, learn and eventually improve. Thus, JADF meetings are a key platform facilitating the implementation of effective decentralization by providing a forum for service provision and development planning accountability. JADF builds on the traditional values of solidarity and mutual support towards a common agenda of ensuring the social welfare of people. JADF applies the traditional practice that any activity or pressing duty that could not have been handled without the help of the community could be assisted upon. Traditional practices used to engage people individually in the past are replicated today at institution level by JADF after combining them with modern participatory concepts, such as: creating a space for inclusive dialogue, synergy and accountability, establishing a shared agenda of development in the District and determining outcomes to be monitored and peer-reviewed. Mission of JADF The mission of JADF is ' to ensure a sustainable socio-economic development and improved service delivery for Rwandan communities through active participation, dialogue, and accountability by sharing information, effective coordination of stakeholders’ interventions in decentralized entities'. Vision The vision of JADF is to have active Rwandan communities participating in sustainable and inclusive development driven by mutual accountability'. RGB as the coordinating organ has the following responsibilities: 1° To ensure that JADF Action plans in Districts are harmonized with JADF national strategic plan; 2° To collect and analyse reports submitted to RGB by Districts JADF 3° To prepare the JADF Stakeholder Consultative Meeting at National level; 4° To prepare National JADF Steering Committee meetings; WHAT ARE RWANDA'S HOMEGROWN INITIATIVES? Rwanda’s Home Grown Initiatives (HGI) comprise a range of institutional and organisational mechanisms developed by Rwandan citizens based on local opportunities, cultural values and the history of the country, to fast track its development Generally, HGI are community based and give a central role to the population in dealing with important social challenges like fostering rural development and social protection, or, in Rwanda’s recent past, handling genocide related trials. These mechanisms often take their inspiration from traditional culture, which enhances their social acceptance. In addition, a number of good practices have been designed to complement HGI. HGI gradually emerged from the challenging post-genocide context. Rwandans were faced with seemingly insurmountable problems – the country had a deep social divide and faced a difficult international environment. However, they were determined to pursue selfreliance (kwigira) and were thus compelled to find innovative solutions. To do so, they used one of their most valuable social resources that was available: their cultural heritage. HGI have strongly contributed to the dynamism of the socioeconomic and political transformation of post-genocide Rwanda, as well as to the achievement of Rwanda’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The World Bank in 2020 said of Rwanda: “a strong focus on homegrown policies and initiatives contributed to a significant improvement in access to services and in human development indicators”. Following their success, the search for home grown mechanisms to deal with matters that concern citizens has been constitutionally mandated. HGI intervene in processes of governance and justice, economy, and social welfare. The key HGI that spurred socio-economic development are listed in Table 1. Table 1: HGI according to three categories GOVERNANCE AND JUSTICE Gacaca (Traditional conflict resolution) Abunzi (Mediation and reconciliation committees) Inama y’Igihugu y’Umushyikirano (National Dialogue Council) Itorero/Ingando (National Civic Education Programme) Umwiherero (National Leadership Retreat) SOCIAL WELFARE Ubudehe (Participatory socio-economic development program) SOCIAL WELFARE Girinka (One Cow per Poor Family) ECONOMY Umuganda (Community work) Imihigo (Performance contracts) How did HGI emerge? The foundation of Rwanda's HGI is the enduring attachment that Rwandans have for their traditional culture and the language they share, Kinyarwanda. Culture The foundation of Rwanda's HGI is the enduring attachment that Rwandans have for their traditional culture and the language they share, Kinyarwanda. Colonial and postcolonial modernisation have not weakened this attachment, not even among the elite. All Rwandans use Kinyarwanda as the main language of communication in their private life and the language has always played an important role in public administration. Moreover, young people, artists and singers continue to use Kinyarwanda as their first language of expression. Outside Rwanda, during their thirty-five years of exile, the hundreds of thousands of refugees scattered throughout the region and the rest of the world maintained an attachment to their traditional culture. The mobilisation of the second generation of refugees who had been born or raised outside Rwanda, to return to their country, was also motivated by the desire to preserve their cultural identity threatened by a prolonged exile. Challenging circumstances At the end of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsis, despite the virulent propaganda which had made it possible, language and culture were essential as a shared social place where the different groups of Rwandans could meet. One episode in particular underscored their importance, and would spark a chain of events that led to the adoption of HGI. Towards the end of 1996, after the massive return of the 1994 refugees who had fled during the campaign to stop the genocide, different groups with potentially antagonistic life histories found themselves in the Kibungo region of eastern Rwanda. Genocide survivors, 1959 refugees who came from camps just across the border in Burundi and Tanzania where they had lived for thirty-five years, people who had never left the region, and recently repatriated 1994 refugees, all gathered in Kibungo. Heightened tensions revolving around access to land surfaced in which different families made conflicting claims to the same land. In the immediate postgenocide context, tensions became deadly. Often security forces and local authorities could not find the culprits or fully understand what was going on, with contentious groups preferring to settle scores in silence. After sensitisation campaigns failed to bring back peace, a decision was made to try to iron out differences in community dialogues. The solution that eventually prevailed was the sharing of land according to the needs of different families, and distribution was negotiated in community assemblies with dynamics similar to traditional Gacaca conflict resolution mechanisms. These community deliberations turned the tide, triggering unexpected collaboration. Noting this, local authorities then asked the population to go beyond the local problems and discuss the causes of the conflict in Rwanda and possible solutions. The grassroots consultations were rolled out countrywide. They generated rich insights and identified five main causes of conflict in Rwanda, which were: bad leadership, poverty, ignorance, impunity, and exclusion. These community discussions, which took place during 1997 and 1998, played an important role in bringing people together at the local level. The government decided to emulate the seminal grassroots exercise by organising in-depth deliberations at the national level in what were named the Urugwiro Village Discussions. The Umuganda tradition of community work had been unpopular before 1994 due to the way it had been organised. However, the strong benefits of gathering people around culturally-rooted practices led to the reinstatement of the practice in 1998 In 2000, Ubudehe, the community participatory socio-economic development mechanism, was also revitalised during the formulation of the first Poverty Reduction Strategy under the Participatory Poverty Assessment Initiative; this signaled the beginning of a more deliberate attempt to utilise hybrid mechanisms that mixed the traditional and the modern, as methods for social action. What makes Rwanda's Homegrown Initiatives work? The effectiveness of HGI in the Rwandan context hinges on a number of factors. The first factor is cultural acceptance, which is a built-in strength of HGI. Their home grown nature enables actors to intimately understand the social setting in which activities are undertaken and to provide a common framework for mutual understanding, between both citizens and administrators. This also promotes genuine ownership. Political will The potency of HGI is also linked to the larger developmental context in which they operate. In this regard, the political intentions set by the Urugwiro Village Discussions were crucial. These discussions had been conceived to find lasting solutions to the deep-rooted problems facing the country and devise the transformation of Rwanda. Meetings were held every Saturday from May 1998 to March 1999, bringing together 164 participants from all sections of society. Two dominant orientations emerged from the discussions: strengthening national unity as the ultimate goal to which all policies must converge, and the idea that citizens must be put at the centre of politics and of development strategies. Subsequent development strategies reaffirmed the political will expressed during the Urugwiro discussions. HGI were thus critical vehicles for placing citizens at the centre of the development and transformation of the country. Since the Urugwiro discussions, HGI have adapted to the changing developmental context, often becoming more technical for the sake of efficiency and transparency. Local government Local government is one vehicle that allows HGI to fully express their potential. Local government underwent a profound reform in 2006 seeking to improve the effectiveness of service delivery, primarily by making administrative and social services more accessible. The point of supply for these services was moved from districts to sectors, which are lower on the administrative hierarchy; however, sectors were expanded from their previous size. A new, more accessible, administrative level was added closer to the population: the village or Umudugudu. The capacity of sectors and districts was raised by raising the professional profiles and remuneration of their managers. Local leaders became an essential and indispensable link and intermediaries between the administration and the population, largely utilising HGI to spur local development. Accountability Accountability mechanisms have further enhanced the effectiveness of HGI. Whilst actions taken by local government are subject to oversight by classical accountability institutions such as the Office of the Auditor General, other accountability mechanisms have been established, notably Imihigo and Umushyikirano, that allow for more active involvement of citizens in line with the philosophy of HGI. Umushyikirano, the National Dialogue Council brings together the President of the Republic and citizens’ representatives to discuss issues relating to the state of the nation and to national unity. The National Dialogue is broadcast live on TV, radio and social media. Citizens are offered toll-free telephone lines to call in and express their grievances or use social media platforms. These demands are expected to be addressed quickly by the relevant institutions of the state. Umushyikirano is a very powerful mechanism incentivising local and central government officials to perform well and avoid being publicly exposed. Presidential visits to the districts, during which the population can speak directly to the head of state and express their concerns, have similar effects to Umushyikirano. These assemblies are broadcast live on national radio and television. Imihigo, which has become known in English as “performance contracts”, trace their origins to an ancient tradition of oathing associated with the military. Such oathing took place prior to going to war, and entailed senior commanders pledging to the king what they would do on the battlefield. When war ended, during a debriefing session, pledges made were meticulously assessed. Modern Imihigo were adopted in 2006 as a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the work of public institutions and that of its public servants. Imihigo detail specific targets government officials must meet in the coming year, and are intended to combine national priorities and community objectives. Imihigo have increasingly bureaucratised into a performance management and Public Financial Management mechanism to systematically avoid false claims of achievements by local leaders. Gacaca GOVERNANCE AND JUSTICE Contemporary Gacaca draws inspiration from the traditional model, by replicating a local community-based justice system with the aim of restoring the social fabric of society. The courts are credited with laying the foundation for peace, reconciliation and unity in Rwanda. The Gacaca courts officially finished their work in June 2012. Overview “ One day during a memorial service, I was approached by a survivor. He was very emotional. ‘Why are you asking us to forgive?’ he asked me. ‘Haven’t we suffered enough? We weren’t the cause of this problem. Why must we provide the solution?’ These were very challenging questions. So I paused for a long time. Then I told him: ‘I’m very sorry. You are correct. I am asking too much of you. But I don’t know what to ask the perpetrators. ‘Sorry’ won’t bring back any lives. Only forgiveness can heal this nation. The burden rests with the survivors because they are the only ones with something to give.” - President Paul Kagame in “Humans of New York” After the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, rendering justice was a huge challenge. Since 1959, those responsible for oppressing and killing Tutsi had benefitted not only from blanket amnesties but also from rewards. The architects of the genocide then engineered mass participation in the killings to blur the lines of individual responsibility. By the year 2000, over 130,000 genocide suspects were detained in precarious conditions. Between 1996 and 1999 only 300-350 cases had been tried by classical courts, it was estimated that it would have taken 100 years to try all of the genocide cases in this way. Contemporary Gacaca draws inspiration from the traditional model, by replicating a local community-based justice system with the aim of restoring the social fabric of society. The courts are credited with laying the foundation for peace, reconciliation and unity in Rwanda. The Gacaca courts officially finished their work in June 2012. The word Gacaca refers to the small clearing where a community would traditionally meet to discuss issues of concern. People of integrity (elders and leaders) in the village known as inyangamugayo, would facilitate a discussion that any member of the community could take part in. Once everyone had spoken, the inyangamugayo would reach a decision about how the problem would be solved. In this way, Gacaca acted very much as a traditional court. If the decision was accepted by all members of the community, the meeting would finish by sharing a drink as a sign of reconciliation. The idea of entrusting genocide trials to community courts inspired by Gacaca, a traditional dispute resolution mechanism, received a range of strong reactions. Some felt that such crimes could not be tried by regular citizens. Others saw in it a manoeuvre to put blame on the entire Hutu population, while others feared it would lead to rampant impunity for genocide perpetrators just as had been the case in the past. Outside Rwanda, jurists worried about the absence of trained magistrates and defense attorneys. Contemporary Gacaca was officially launched on 18 June 2002 by President Paul Kagame. The main objective of Gacaca was to reconcile Rwandans through a process of participatory justice. Members of each community were to play all key roles, as prosecutors, judges and witnesses. Gacaca courts relied on the categorisation of offenses and reduced sentences for those who confessed voluntarily and asked for forgiveness. In total, 1,958,634 genocide-related cases were tried through Gacaca. The Gacaca courts officially finished their work ten years later on 18 June 2012. They are credited with laying the foundation for peace, reconciliation and unity in Rwanda. How did the Gacaca courts work? The aims of the Gacaca were: 1. To expose the truth about the Genocide against the Tutsi 2. To speed up genocide trials 3. To eradicate impunity 4. To strengthen unity and reconciliation among Rwandans 5. To draw on the capacity of Rwandans to solve their own problems The following principles guided the Gacaca process: 1. Genocide suspects were classified into categories based on the gravity of the charges brought against them 2. Opportunity was given to genocide suspects to admit and confess to their crimes and to ask for forgiveness; when their confessions were accepted, their sentences were reduced 3. Special sentencing was given for those who committed genocide crimes as minors As described above, suspects were placed into one of the following four categories as per the Gacaca law of 2001: Category One:Planners, organisers, instigators, supervisors and ringleaders of the genocide or crimes against humanity as well as those who committed rape or sexual torture. Suspects identified through Gacaca as belonging to category 1 were tried by ordinary courts. Category Two:Perpetrators, co-perpetrators or accomplices of murder or serious violence against individuals, causing death together with accomplices. Those who injured others or committed other acts of serious violence with the intention to kill, but who did not attain their objective. Category Three:Those who committed other acts of serious violence without the intention to kill. Category Four:Those who committed offences only against property From 2004 to 2007, these four categories were revised down to three to streamline the process and from March 2007 onward they were as shown in table 1. Category 1 (tried by ordinary courts) • A person who occupied positions of leadership • A person who committed acts of rape or sexual torture Category 2 • A well-known and zealous murderer • A person who committed acts of torture against others • A person who committed dehumanising acts on the dead • A person whose criminal acts or participation placed him/her among those of the killers or perpetrators of serious attacks against others, causing death • A person who injured or committed other acts of serious attacks, with intention to kill, but who did not attain his or her objective • A person who committed or participated in criminal acts against persons, without any intention of killing them Category 3 • A person who committed offences only against property Organisation and functioning of Gacaca Courts While Gacaca courts were given competence similar to other judicial systems, they also had the special competence of investigating the manner in which crimes were committed, a task normally carried out by the prosecution department. Gacaca Courts were created, in each Cell, Sector, District “or Town” and Province/Kigali City of the Republic of Rwanda. This court was responsible for handling crimes of Genocide and other crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda between October 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 1994 within the limits of the law. 1. Organs of Gacaca Courts Each Gacaca Court was comprised of a General Assembly, a Bench and a Coordination Committee. The General Assembly The General Assembly of each “Gacaca Court” held an ordinary meeting once a month and an extraordinary session wherever it was required for the good functioning of the “Gacaca Court”. Decisions of the General Assembly were taken by consensus or, otherwise at the absolute majority of its members. This monthly meeting was aimed at evaluating the activities of the Bench and the coordinating committee. The General Assembly of the Cell Gacaca Court was called upon to give information regarding the perpetrators and victims of Genocide; where every inhabitant of the Cell had to indicate the place where he or she resided before and during Genocide, the individual also testified on what he or she knew about the crimes of Genocide committed in the Cell. The Seat The members of the bench of “Gacaca Courts” commonly known as Inyangamugayo judges were Rwandans of integrity elected by the General Assembly of the Cell in which they resided. Each bench of the Gacaca Court was composed of 19 individuals of integrity. The election of inyangamugayo was conducted countrywide from 4-7 October 2001; other elections were held to replace inyangamugayo who were no longer able to serve on the courts. Thirty-four percent of the inyangamugayo were women. The National Service of Gacaca Courts organised general training sessions for all Gacaca inyangamugayo countrywide, and provided special training sessions for the courts that demonstrated the need for supplementary training. These inyangamugayo mainly comprised school teachers, civil servants and business people. The Coordination Committee The Coordination Committee was composed of a President, first Vice-President, second Vice-President and two secretaries, all of whom had to be able to read and write Kinyarwanda. Members of a “Gacaca Court” seat elected the Coordination Committee among themselves, with a simple majority. The Coordination Committee of every “Gacaca Court” carried out the following functions: • to convene, preside over meetings and coordinate activities of the Bench for the Gacaca Court as well its General Assembly, • to register complaints, testimonies and evidences given by the population; • to receive and record files for suspects answerable to “Gacaca Court”; • to register appeals filed against judgements passed by “Gacaca Courts”; • to forward files of judgements appealed against to Gacaca Courts of Appeal; • to register decisions made by organs of the “Gacaca Court”; • to prepare reports of activities of “Gacaca Courts”; • to implement decisions of the General Assembly and those of the “Gacaca Court” Bench; • to immediately transfer the report of activities approved by the General Assembly of the “Gacaca Court” to superior Gacaca Courts. The Coordination Committee of the “Gacaca Court” met as many times as possible, convened by its President, of his own initiative or requested by at least two members of the committee. In order to sit validly, the Coordination Committee had to have at least three of its members present, of whom one was a secretary. Decisions were made by consensus. If there was no consensus, the matter was submitted to the “Gacaca Court” Bench. 2. Duties of Gacaca Courts The law provided for specific duties for each Gacaca Court: The Cell Gacaca Court The Cell Gacaca Court exercised the following duties: • to make up a list of individuals: o Who resided in the cell before and after Genocide; o Suspected of having participated in Genocide; o Victims and their damaged properties; • to bring together the files forwarded by the Public Prosecution; • to categorise suspects according to the provisions of this Organic Law; • to try cases related to properties; • to give a ruling on the disqualification of members of the Bench of Gacaca Court of the Cell; • to receive confessions from individuals who participated in Genocide; • to forward the files which are not in their jurisdiction to the competent Courts; • to elect members of the Coordination Committee The Gacaca Court of the Sector, District or Town and that of the Province or Kigali City The Gacaca Court Bench of the Sector, District or Town and that of the Province or Kigali City had the following duties among others: • Conducting investigations, if necessary, on testimonies given; • to receive confessions from individuals who participated in genocide; • to give a ruling on the disqualification of members of the Bench; • to try cases falling under its jurisdiction, after making sure that suspects forwarded to it, have been categorised in conformity with the alleged offences; • examining appeals against judgements passed by Gacaca Courts of the inferior level within its jurisdiction; • electing members of the Coordination Committee; • Examining reports of activities from the lower Gacaca Courts of its jurisdiction. 3. The jurisdictions of Gacaca The Cell Gacaca Court The Cell Gacaca Court, operating at the second lowest local government level, the cell, dealt with crimes in category three. It dealt also with objections filed against the sentence pronounced in the absence of the accused. The Cell Gacaca Court categorised alleged perpetrators of the genocide. The Sector Gacaca Court The Sector Gacaca Court, operating at the sector level which is the next local government level up from the cell, dealt with defendants whose offences fell into category three, as well as opposition made against sentences pronounced in the absence of the accused. The District or Town Gacaca Court The District or Town Gacaca Court, operating at the district level which is the next local government level up from the sector, dealt with crimes in category two, appeals filed against judgments at the first level, or decisions by Sector Gacaca Courts that were rendered in the absence of the accused. The Gacaca Court of the Province or Kigali City The Gacaca Court of the Province or Kigali City, operating at the province or Kigali City level which is the next local government level up from the district, dealt with appeals of judgments rendered at the first level, or on objection by Gacaca Courts of the District or Town. Analysis of the cases After information about a case was presented to the courts, it was analysed by the inyangamugayo of the Gacaca court at the cell level. These judges then prepared a file for those who were accused of committing crimes. Based on the gravity of the crimes allegedly committed, the suspect was put in one of the three categories described above. After the inyangamugayo had prepared the file and categorised it appropriately, it was then submitted to the court with the competence to judge it. The files of the first and second categories were submitted to the Gacaca court of the sector, while those in the third category remained in the Gacaca court of the cell. During this investigative phase, the number of suspects increased significantly which placed a strain on the courts’ ability to deliver timely justice to victims. Hearings Gacaca hearings were public, except for those recorded on camera as decided by the court, or upon the request of any interested party; hearings were decided with a pronounced judgment for reasons of public order. Deliberations of inyangamugayo were conducted in private. Every Gacaca court held a hearing at least once per week usually beginning at 8:30am and finishing at 4pm. Whoever was summoned to appear before the court, whether accused, witness, victim or any other person, needed to be informed at least seven days before the trial. If the defendant had neither a known address nor residence in Rwanda, the summons period was one month. At every hearing, the president of the court requested all those present to observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of genocide. Before testifying, the witness had to take an oath and swear to tell the truth. The sessions were governed by a set of eight rules which ensured the proper and respectful functioning of the hearing. These rules stipulated that those present raise their hand to speak, prohibited insults or threats, and obliged participants to always tell the truth.

The trials judged by the courts of appeals number 178,741, equivalent to 9% of the 1,958,634 cases judged by Gacaca. Social impact Gacaca courts officially finished their work on 18 June 2012 and by that time a total of 1,958,634 genocide related cases had been tried throughout the country. The Centre for Conflict Management at the National University of Rwanda carried out a study to determine the extent to which Rwandans believe that Gacaca had attained its five objectives. The following are the results for each of the five objectives, the average percentage of which was 88%: 1. Finding out and disclosing the truth about the genocide: 84% 2. Speeding up the genocide trials: 87% 3. Ending the culture of impunity: 87% 4. Strengthening unity and reconciliation: 87% 5. Demonstrating the capacity of Rwandans to resolve their own problems: 95% Whilst many had expected the processing of cases through the courts to take far longer, Gacaca defied these expectations and played a key role in delivering timely justice for many victims of the genocide. Perceptions of the nature of relations among citizens, including the level of social cohesion presented later, were strongly influenced by the Gacaca tribunals that had just finished their work. Three years after the official end of the Gacaca phase, there was a general feeling that a milestone had been reached that decreased the weight of the memory of the genocide. The Gacaca process had “broken the ice” in Rwandan communities, making possible a serious discussion of what happened during the genocide. For survivors, the most tangible benefit of Gacaca was that many among them were finally able to find the remains of the bodies of their loved ones and bury them with dignity, and to mourn. Gacaca offered public recognition of the pain of the most isolated survivors. The process of confession and asking to be pardoned by the victims, even if imperfect, created the basis on which more peaceful social interaction finally became possible; according to one survivor of the genocide: “Before Gacaca, there was hardly any confidence. In fact, there wasn’t any at all. Repatriated refugees did not want to tell the truth about how people had been killed, those who killed them and where the bodies were. Since Gacaca, I feel that people grew closer together as the truth gradually came out. Even if some hid the truth, those who were in prison told the truth. It was the prisoners who told the truth about how people had been killed. That’s how we made progress: thanks to the prisoners who confessed after they understood that they should tell the truth. We learned, understood and finally accepted.” The World Values survey carried out at the midpoint and at the end of the Gacaca process suggested a reinforcement of social cohesion primarily through the responses to the question “Can you trust most people?” In the 2007 survey, Rwandans expressed one of the lowest levels of social confidence in the world with only 5 percent of positive responses. In 2012, Rwanda considerably improved its score, with a level of trust in others of 17 percent, one of the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Abunzi GOVERNANCE AND JUSTICE The system of community mediators, also known as Abunzi, combines traditional and modern methods of conflict resolution. It is also one of Rwanda's Homegrown Initiatives (HGI), although similar mechanisms exist elsewhere. Overview “ Unlike ordinary courts whose decisions specify the winner and the loser who, in most cases, keep living in an antagonistic relationship, Abunzi strive to help litigants to resume former normal relationships or at least mitigate the magnitude of their dispute” A participant in a group discussion in Kicukiro District The system of community mediators, also known as Abunzi, combines traditional and modern methods of conflict resolution. It is also one of Rwanda’s Home Grown Initiatives (HGI), although similar mechanisms exist elsewhere. The word Abunzi can be translated as “those who reconcile” or “those who bring together”, from the verb kunga. Traditionally in Rwanda, Abunzi were people known within their communities for personal integrity, and were thus asked to intervene in the event of conflict. Each conflicting party would choose a person who was considered trustworthy, who was known as a problem-solver, and who was unlikely to alienate either party. The purpose of this system was to settle disputes and to reconcile the conflicting parties and restore harmony within the affected community. The reintroduction of the Abunzi system in 2004 was motivated partly by the desire to reduce the backlog of court cases, and partly to decentralise justice and make it more affordable and accessible to citizens seeking to resolve conflicts without the cost of going to court. Today, Abunzi is fully integrated into Rwanda’s justice system. This conflict resolution mechanism rooted in Rwandan culture, came to be perceived as more accessible and less threatening, and therefore more human. Those who referred their cases to Abunzi were more comfortable with this system because the Abunzi came from within their own community and thus had a better understanding of the issues and process at hand. As theAbunzi system gained more recognition as a successful method to resolve conflict and deliver justice, the importance of providing more structure and formality to their work increased. Consequently, the Abunzi started receiving training on resolving domestic conflicts, as well as logistical support from both governmental and nongovernmental organisations, to improve the quality of their mediation services. There are now over 30,000 Abunzi operating across Rwanda. According to the Ministry of Justice 2019 annual report, during the fiscal year ending June 2019, Abunzi received 48,989 civil cases, of which 47,898 (97.8%) were completed (at sector and cell level) and just 1,091 (2.2%) were ongoing at the end of the year. The same report also describes the support given to Abunzi mediators during the 2018-2019 fiscal year: a total of 15,183 Abunzi and their 56,799 dependents were provided with 100% community health insurance; a total of 13,030 Abunzi were provided with monthly communication airtime to facilitate communication with fellow Abunzi and staff from the Ministry of Justice; and a total of 8,100 Abunzi were provided with bicycles to facilitate their daily work, bringing the total number of bicycles provided to 13,100. Conflict resolution through community participation The adoption of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in Rwanda emerged from the recognition of a growing crisis in the judiciary in which it had become almost impossible to resolve disputes efficiently and in a cost-effective manner. The Government of Rwanda concluded that modern judicial mechanisms of dispute resolution were failing to deliver, and so the decision was taken to examine traditional mediation and conciliation approaches as alternatives. Doing so would not only help alleviate the pressure on conventional courts, but would also align with the policy objective of a more decentralised justice system. Establishment and purpose of the Abunzi In 2004, the Government of Rwanda established the traditional process of Abunzi as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. Established at the cell and sector levels, Abunzi primarily address family disputes, such as those relating to land or inheritance. By institutionalising Abunzi, low-level legal issues could be solved at a local level without the need for them to be heard in conventional courts. As the Abunzi system gained recognition as a successful method to resolve conflict and deliver justice, the importance of providing more structure and formality to the their work. Evaluation of the impact of Abunzi In 2018, the Rwanda Governance Board (RGB) conducted a survey of public perceptions of Abunzi. Respondents highlighted the following positive attributes of Abunzi in relation to ordinary courts: • A reduction in time spent to settle cases (86.7%) • A reduction in the cost of cases (84.2%) • The ability of Abunzi to mitigate conflicts between litigants (80.1%) The figures below reflect the overall level of citizen satisfaction with the performance of Abunzi committees, showing an increase of about 19% between 2012 and 2018. Overall citizen satisfaction level in the performance of Abunzi Source: Rwanda Governance Board report, 2018 Source: Rwanda Governance Board report, 2018 The figure above shows that citizens were highly satisfied with the impact of Abunzi on a range of issues, including their impact on enhancing social cohesion (96.9% in 2018), on solving communities’ own problems (96.9% in 2018), on reducing expenses compared to ordinary courts (96.6% in 2018), on reducing time spent in cases in ordinary courts (96.4% in 2018) and on reconciling people who were in conflict (95.2% in 2018). The numbers also show a small increase in satisfaction between 2017 and 2018. A participant in a group discussion in Karongi District stated: “ Cases examined by Abunzi used to be taken to ordinary courts. A case could take two years or more and people were impoverished due to travelling to Rusizi [in former Cyangugu prefecture] to have our cases examined there. We would spend all the little money we had. Sometimes we used to sell our cattle or pieces of land to get money to spend in courts. We have no words to express our excitement about Abunzi. This is a justice of proximity and free of charge”. The cost relative to ordinary courts is widely considered a key advantage of the Abunzi system. For example, the average cost of each case settled by community Abunzi was RWF 20,700 or around USD 32 as of February 2013. However, the cost per case in ordinary courts was RWF 280,738 or USD 446. Beneficial practices The RGB survey also asked participants to highlight positive attributes of the Abunzi system; these are as follows: • Pre-hearing counselling: Before cases are heard, Abunzi call on both plaintiff and defendant to emphasise the importance of social cohesion and conflict-resolution through community mediation. In some instances, both parties opt to withdraw the case at this point, and come instead to a mutual agreement. In other cases, litigants are more inclined to accept, rather than appeal, the mediation decision as a result of the counselling. • Reduced social distance between parties and mediators: Since Abunzi are members of the same community from which disputants come, the latter feel less intimidated and more comfortable expressing themselves during those sessions, whether these sessions are public or on camera. • Integrity over legal literacy: In the RGB study, the majority of participants stated that the fact that integrity determines the selection of Abunzi, confers trust and confidence in the committees and fosters an environment in which justice prevails. • Parties' freedom to choose Abunzi: Participants highlighted that the freedom to choose mediators helps to ensure equal treatment during mediation and reduces the likelihood of corruption. • Win-win approach: During mediation, Abunzi Committees avoid referring to either party as the 'winner' or the 'loser' as these words can create resentment and foster conflict, and the goal is to find a lasting solution through reconciliation. Umushyikirano GOVERNANCE AND JUSTICE The National Dialogue Council known as Umushyikirano is one of Rwanda’s Homegrown Initiatives. The word Umushyikirano translates to a meeting where participants are able to exchange ideas, share experiences and question each other. Overview The word Umushyikirano translates to a meeting in which participants are able to exchange ideas, share experiences and ask questions of one another. Today, Umushyikirano is known as the National Dialogue Council and is constitutionally mandated. Umushyikirano is a forum in which participants debate issues relating to the state of the nation, the state of local governance and national unity. Every year, the President of the Republic of Rwanda chairs Umushyikirano, during which Rwandans from all walks of life have the opportunity to ask questions directly to their leaders. The event is attended by members of the Cabinet and Parliament, representatives of the Rwandan community abroad, local government, media entities, the diplomatic community and others invited by the President. Those unable to attend in person at Rwanda’s parliament building, can do so via telephone, SMS, Twitter and Facebook or can follow the debate live through television and radio coverage of the event. The first National Dialogue Council took place on 28 June 2003; the event has been held each year ever since. Umushyikirano aims to be a leading example of participatory and inclusive governance. It is hoped that by directly engaging with their leaders, Rwandans feel part of the decision making that affects their lives. Umushyikirano also serves as a forum for Rwandans to hold their leaders and government to account. Over the past 15 years, Umushyikirano has proposed transformational ideas, and made important contributions to nation-building; examples include: Umwalimu SACCO (the savings and credit cooperative for teachers), Abunzi (the mediation committees) and Girinka (the One cow per poor family programme). The Office of the Prime Minister (PMO) is responsible for the overall coordination of Umushyikirano. How does Umushyikirano work? The gathering Each year around a thousand people attend the event in person, while thousands more follow the proceedings through live radio and TV coverage or via online streams, and thanks to such technology, citizens from the Rwandan community abroad can also participate. Each Umushyikirano has a theme and participants are asked to pose questions related to that theme or any other development issue. Once a participant has asked a question, whether in person or remotely, the leader responsible for that area responds. All questions are recorded. The following year, the Umushyikirano session starts with the reading of a report that details actions taken in response to queries and requests made by the public the year before; the report includes the dates on which the actions were completed. Umushyikirano also hosts diaspora Rwandans who have come to visit the country under the Come and See, Go and Tell programme. This is an initiative that brings Rwandans living abroad to come and tour Rwanda, see for themselves the reconstruction and reconciliation efforts being made, and go back to mobilise their families and communities to return home. Planning Preparatory meetings for Umushyikirano begin in October of each year. These meetings are chaired by the Director of Cabinet in PMO. The decisions taken on the budget, theme, presentations to be given and other matters, are also their responsibility. While PMO is responsible for overall coordination, representatives from the following institutions are also involved in organising the National Dialogue Council. • Office of the President (responsible for agenda, protocol, and communications) • Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (responsible for budgetary matters) • Ministry of Health (responsible for first aid and emergency medical matters) • Ministry of Local Government (responsible for inviting local government representatives) • Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (responsible for inviting representatives from the Rwandan community abroad and international guests) • Ministry of Infrastructure (responsible for transport) • Office of the Government Spokesperson (responsible for communications, social media integration and AskGov) Implementation process The successful implementation of the resolutions taken during the Umushyikirano meetings is an important factor that justifies their relevance. The implementation of the Umushyikirano’s resolutions have been analysed at the local level through citizen surveys, and at the national level through analysis of various Umushyikirano reports from PMO. Impact The main achievements of Umushyikirano are the participation of Rwandans in national decision making and the fast-tracking of government programmes and citizen priorities based on the resolutions tabled each year. Umushyikirano also plays an important role in bonding Rwandans living abroad with their country of origin. Results of 17 th Umushyikirano (19– 20 December 2019) The 17th National Umushyikirano Council (NUC) held from 19th to 20th of December 2019 adopted 12 resolutions which were translated into 36 actionable milestones. The report on the implementation of the 17th Umushyikirano resolution provides details of achievements but also dedicates a whole section on two milestones lagging behind.

The following statistics reported against the 2017 Umushyikirano resolutions demonstrate the impact of Umushyikirano in incentivising and motivating policy implementation. On an education-themed resolution, the report stated that a total of 1,370 smart classrooms had been built, 922 classrooms had been constructed and rehabilitated, and 1,344 toilets had been constructed. The report gave a figure of 62,616 teachers trained in the Competency-Based Curriculum in 2018 compared with 54,718 in 2017, and stated a total of 4,417 school-based mentors in 2018 up from 4,160 in 2017. It also reported that 727 trainers had been trained for skills upgrading against a target of 500 in 2018, and 713 students had been trained in Early Childhood Teaching in Teacher Training Colleges compared to a target of 600 in the same year. Teachers in primary schools had worked two four-hour shifts, but the move to a single shift in the P6 school year meant that the school day could increase from four to six hours for P6 students. The 2017 Umushyikirano report stated that the school dropout rate had decreased from 11% in 2012 to 5.6% in 2016 and that 55,533 students returned to school in 2017. Finally, on the education theme, 20 out of a target of 30 STEM programmes were accredited in 2018. On a health-themed resolution, 409 medical doctors were reported as “being supported in specialisation”, 260,856 people were screened for Hepatitis B and C, and 145,303 citizens were “treated during the outreach”. On another resolution on fighting drug abuse as well as illicit trafficking, the sentence period for these crimes was increased from 2-5 years to 7-25 years, and 4,123 “delinquents” were rehabilitated, trained and equipped with hands-on skills. On the Early Childhood Programme, nutrition and hygiene resolution, the report stated that 74,288 children and 13,111 women in category 1 received Fortified Blended Foods. On the resolution to increase access toaffordableelectricity, the report found that 138,290 households were connected to the grid in 2018 compared to a target of 115,979; whereas 61,546 households were connected off-grid against a higher target of 91,142. Two hundred and eighteen megawatts of electricity-generating capacity were installed. On the National Service programme and the Itorero programme, the report added that 55,270 Intore were trained and deployed for national service, 4,503 schools now had Itorero and 10,526 villages had Itorero; and the Intore mu Biruhuko Programme was created. Itorero GOVERNANCE AND JUSTICE The Civic Education Program, also known as Itorero, is one of Rwanda's Homegrown Initiatives (HGI). Itorero was reintroduced in 2009 as a way to rebuild the nation’s social fabric and mobilise Rwandans to uphold important cultural values and to spur a sense of dedication to their country. Overview The Civic Education Program, also known as Itorero, is one of Rwanda’s Home Grown Initiatives (HGI). Traditional Itorero was a leadership and cultural school in which Rwandans would learn language, patriotism, social relations, sports, dancing, songs, martial arts and leadership. Itorero was reintroduced in 2009 as a way to rebuild the nation’s social fabric and mobilise Rwandans to uphold important cultural values and to spur a sense of dedication to their country. The culture of an Intore (a person who has received the teachings of Itorero) is regarded highly. The modern Itorero programme creates opportunities for participants to enhance positive values, build a sense of responsibility through patriotism, build a culture of volunteerism and hone professional abilities. Through Itorero and similar initiatives, the Government of Rwanda sought to reintroduce the culture of serving the country at no financial reward to encourage selfless service - attributes that contribute to accelerating progress and promoting social cohesion, peaceful cohabitation and public integrity. Itorero ry’Igihugu, the National Itorero Commission, is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the programme and of ensuring that Rwandans from all walks of life have the opportunity to take part. By June 2017, the National Itorero Commission trained more than 1,700,000 Intore from various sectors including teachers, health workers, executive secretaries, farmers, community policing committees as well as students from Rwanda and the diaspora. Traditional Itorero Traditional Itorero sought to form complete and distinguished leaders mastering the various aspects of the country’s social, cultural, political and military life. Young people were sent in the Itorero care from the early adolescence until their early twenties. Itorero trainers planned daily activities according to different priorities and every newcomer in Itorero had to undergo initiation, known in Kinyarwanda as gukuramo ubunyamusozi. The common belief was that the people who had been trained in Itorero, stood out from the rest of the community, especially in matters of expression and behaviour, because they were expected to be quick thinkers, experts in social relations, and knowledgeable individuals. Each Itorero included 40 to 100 participants of various age groups and had its own unique name. The best graduates would receive cows or land as rewards. The tradition of Itorero provided formative training for future leaders. These community leaders and fighters were selected from Intore (individuals who took part in Itorero) and were trained in military tactics, hand-to-hand combat, jumping, racing, javelin throwing, archery and endurance. They were also taught economics, ethical values, Rwandan cultural values, management of men, eloquence, hunting and loyalty to the army. Traditionally, Itorero was found at two levels of the traditional administration: at regional chief’s court and the king’s court. Training in Itorero was preceded by training within the family. At the family level, both girls and boys would be educated on how to fulfil their responsibilities as defined by the expectations of their communities. For example, the man was expected to protect his family and the country, while the woman was expected to provide a good home and environment for her family. Adults were also asked to treat every child as their own in order to promote good behaviour among children. At the chiefly level, a teenage boy was selected by either his father or head of the extended family to be introduced to the chief so he could join his Itorero group. Selection was based on good behaviour among the rest of his family and his community. At the king’s court – the highest level of Itorero – the person selected to join could either be the son of a man who went through the king’s Itorero or a young man who distinguished himself while in the chief’s Itorero. The king could also select the young man who would join his Itorero based on his own observations of the candidate in action. Both the chief-level and king’s court-level Itorero trainings lasted for long periods of time to test the perseverance of the participants. Those who performed well would be rewarded with cows, allowed to return home and get married, or were nominated to various national duties. Intore who distinguished themselves were called “Intore zo ku mukondo”, which translates as the “first rate Intore”. During colonisation, traditional Itorero gradually disappeared because the values taught there opposed the structures imposed on society by colonization. In 1924, the colonial administration prohibited classic Itorero and introduced western-style schools. During and after the colonial period, the Itorero became purely cultural institutions, focusing on song and dance. Itorero ry’Igihugu – Contemporary Itorero The reintroduction of Itorero in 2009 aimed to develop a civic education programme based on patriotic values that strengthen Rwandan citizens’ contribution to the development of their country and the well-being of their society. A National Itorero Commission (NIC), Itorero ry’Igihugu in Kinyarwanda, was created to drive the programme. It is an independent commission with responsibility for planning, implementation, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of Itorero programmes at all levels of society. The vision of the National Itorero Commission The vision of NIC is to help to build a society with a shared mindset and values that promote unity and patriotism, as well as awareness of the goals of the country and how they can be achieved. The main objectives of NIC are: • To train Rwandans: o to better understand their shared values; o to be good and active citizens who are patriotic and who actively contribute to national development; o to be Intore who are worthy Rwandans at all levels of society and to be catalysts for positive change; o to acquire the culture of volunteerism through national service. • To promote respect for positive cultural values as a basis for coexistence and national development • To collaborate with other public and private institutions and nongovernmental organisations with similar objectives • To prepare and monitor volunteerism through national service The values of Itorero (Indagagaciro) At the heart of the Itorero programme lies a set of values, which defines an ethical framework. Contempory Itorero promotes the following values: • Unity • Patriotism • Selflessness • Integrity • Responsibility • Volunteerism • Humility Itorero training sessions The main activity of Itorero is a series of training sessions that include lessons on Rwanda’s history and culture along with physical activities; these sessions aim to educate Rwandans on positive cultural values which had been lost during colonisation. During Itorero sessions, trainings are adapted and tailored to the needs of particular participants. For example, teachers and health workers cover activities related to their profession while local leaders are trained in public service delivery and good governance. During Itorero training sessions, presentations and discussions have the following aims: • To endow participants with the capacity to analyse their own problems and to find solutions • To promote the Kinyarwanda language, as well as the Rwandan spirit and Rwandan cultural values, in order to build better social relations and achieve a good life • To mentor participants to develop a spirit of cooperation and to embrace innovation and a culture of performance • To inform participants about the country’s most significant policies and programmes • To sensitise participants about the importance of a range of valuable practices including physical fitness, cleanliness at home, environmental protection, a culture of debate, family conflict resolution mechanisms, compliance with the law, and the need to combat corruption and aggressive behaviour • To sensitise participants about the importance of building and promoting a culture of peace that is based on mutual respect, trust, humility, democratic values, human rights, and the fight against discriminatory behavior and genocide ideology • To sensitise participants on the importance of efficiency in service delivery, professional stamina, and the ability to deliver good and efficient work. Participants Itorero is designed for all Rwandans. Different curricula have been developed to suit the programme's varied participants. Children of seven years and above take part in Itorero in their Imidugudu (Villages) to help them grow up to become responsible citizens. Others keen to participate are given the opportunity to do so according to their professional backgrounds. Young Rwandans from the Diaspora on holidays in Rwanda can join Urugerero and a number of young Rwandans have organized Itorero in cities including London and Brussels. Non-nationals who wish to participate and provide service to the country can also do so. University graduates and retired people who participated in Urugerero before and wish to do so again are also given the opportunity to join Itorero. National Service (Urugerero) National Service (Urugerero) is designed for those between the ages of 18-35 who have completed secondary education with the aim of developing a sense of fraternity, national identity and participation in national programmes among the Rwandan youth. Whilst the curriculum content of Itorero ry’Igihugu is particular to Rwanda as it is based on principles and values unique to the Rwandan culture; Urugerero (National Service), has much in common with what takes place in other countries. Under Urugerero, thousands of youths have built housing units for the vulnerable, set up kitchen gardens for disadvantaged households to help meet beneficiaries’ nutritional needs, fixed roads and bridges especially in rural neighbourhoods, and played a part in mobilisation for vital socioeconomic causes. Districts have started to integrate Urugerero into their mainstream development and ecosystem services. Urugerero is still developing and reaching out to potential partners which may include government organs, businesses and non-governmental organisations, in order expand the scope of the activities available to youth. The main achievements of Itorero From 2007 to 2017, over 1,700,000 people from both public and private institutions were trained under Itorero from all walks of life, as shown in the figure below. Categories of Intore trained from 2007 to 2017 NUDC Amazina y'imitwe y'Intore 2017. Itorero complements other government programmes and policies, contributing to strengthening intangible elements that make these programmes work such as a sentiment of ownership and a sense of civic responsibility and accountability. Ingando GOVERNANCE AND JUSTICE The Solidarity Camp, also known as Ingando, is one of Rwanda’s HGI. The word Ingando comes from the verb ‘kugandika’, which means going to stay in a place far from one’s home, often with a group, for a specific reason. Traditionally, Ingando was a retreat during which elders, leaders or young people left their homes and stayed in a place where they would meditate and share ideas on how to solve problems affecting their communities or the nation. Overview The word Ingando comes from the verb ‘kugandika’, which means going to stay in a place far from one’s home, often with a group, for a specific reason. Traditionally, Ingando was a retreat during which elders, leaders or young people left their homes and stayed in a place where they would meditate and share ideas on how to solve problems affecting their communities or the nation. According to historical sources, Ingando was the military camp or assembly area where troops received briefings on their organisation and mission in preparing for battle. These men were reminded to put their differences behind them and focus on the goal of protecting their nation. Ingando could also be a place to stop and rest or a secluded place where followers of a religion performed their rites. The term Ingando has since evolved to describe a place where a group of people gather to work towards a common goal. Ingando trainings have served as de facto think-tanks in which the sharing of ideas was encouraged. Ingando also included the community work Umuganda. These trainings created a framework for the reevaluation of divisive ideologies present in Rwanda during the colonial and postcolonial periods. Ingando was designed to provide a space for young people to prepare for a better future in which negative ideologies of the past would no longer influence them. One aim of Ingando is to reduce fear and suspicion and encourage reconciliation between genocide survivors and those with family members who perpetrated the genocide. Ingando trainings also serve to reduce the distance between some segments of the Rwandan population and the government. Through Ingando, participants learn about history as well as current development and reconciliation policies, and are encouraged to play an active role in the rebuilding of their nation. Connection to Itorero The activities of Ingando involved various groups of students until 2007, when another HGI, Itorero (National Civic Education) was implemented. Students in Rwanda and abroad began participating in Itorero, which focused on the reintroduction of lost cultural values in order to strengthen different communities. The groups that continue to take part in Ingando are those striving to be reintegrated into mainstream society, such as former combatants who recently returned home, war veterans, and street kids. The objectives of Ingando The aims of Ingando were as follows: • To promote a platform for the exchange of ideas and experience among Rwandans • To encourage Rwandans to improve management of their communities • To encourage self-reliance within the community • To cultivate a culture of volunteerism among Rwandans • To lead every section of the population towards peace and reconciliation • To promote social cohesion through civic education • To help build shelters for disadvantaged genocide survivors and other vulnerable citizens Ingando trainings also had a socioeconomic aspect as they included community service activities. The trainees wore military uniforms to be more comfortable with the military institution. They were also experiencing life in the outdoors outside of their comfort zone and adapting physically and mentally to harsh environments. The training aimed to change negative perceptions about different aspects of the government and reduce the distance some people perceived between themselves, the government and its policies. Ingando also aimed to teach participants how to face certain challenges and overcome them. Ingando graduates learned new skills to help them find new ways to become more financially stable and organised themselves into cooperatives. In the case of students, those who went to Ingando showed their aptitude at resolving conflicts and fighting genocide ideologies in their schools and universities. The trainings conducted with genocide perpetrators also helped during the Gacaca trials, as participants opened up and talked about the roles they played during the genocide, confessing their crimes. Telling the truth helped to create an environment that allowed the perpetrators to return to their villages and do community service activities to help rebuild the lives of the victims. Ingando participants Between 1999 and 2010, before Ingando for civilians was taken over by Itorero, over 90,000 people took part in the trainings, which were organised by the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission. Table 1: Ingando participants: Impact of Ingando Ingando has contributed significantly to national unity and reconciliation in Rwanda, and this was especially true for sessions conducted during the early years of the programme (between 1996 and 1999) when most participants were returning combatants or Rwandans afraid or unsure of their new government. Special attention was paid to social justice and helping participants understand government strategies to improve social welfare. This approach was key to ensure that progress made in reconciliation was sustainable. When the programme was established, it faced significant challenges including a lack of trust between participants and facilitators, as well as low quality facilities. These issues were slowly overcome as more resources were dedicated to the programme. With time the objectives of the programme were better understood and it became properly integrated into Rwandan society. Umwiherero COMMUNITY WORK The National Leadership Retreat, also known as Umwiherero is one of Rwanda’s Homegrown Initiatives. Umwiherero, best translated as “retreat”, refers to a tradition in Rwandan culture where leaders convene in a secluded place in order to reflect on issues affecting their communities. Overview Umwiherero, best translated as “retreat”, refers to a tradition in Rwandan culture in which leaders convene in a secluded place to reflect on issues affecting their communities, with the objective of identifying solutions. On a smaller scale, this term also refers to the action of moving to a quiet place to discuss issues with a small group of people. In modern times, the Government of Rwanda has drawn on this tradition to reflect on, and address, the challenges the country faces on an annual basis. Umwiherero is organized by the Office of the President (OTP) in conjunction with the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO). The President chairs Umwiherero, during which presentations and discussions focus on a broad range of development challenges, including economics, politics, justice, infrastructure, health, education, and others. Contemporary Umwiherero was originally intended exclusively for senior public officials but has evolved to include leaders from the private sector and from civil society. Improvement over time Umwiherero began in 2004. The first four years of Umwiherero saw mixed results, and in this period it tended to be a grand yet unstructured brainstorming discussion. To streamline and strengthen government coordination, President Paul Kagame established the Strategy and Policy Unit in OTP and the Coordination Unit in PMO. At the same time, the Ministry of Cabinet Affairs was set up to improve the functioning of the Cabinet. The two newly formed units in OTP and PMO were tasked with working together to implement Umwiherero. While the first retreat which was organised by the two new teams, suffered from similar problems to previous retreats, in recent years improvements have been noticeable. Following Umwiherero in 2009, the Minister of Cabinet Affairs served as head of the newly formed steering committee tasked with overseeing the retreat. The steering committee was comprised of fourteen members. Alongside the steering committee, working groups were set up to define the priorities to be included on the retreat agenda. This process was overseen by the Strategy and Policy Unit which developed a concept paper with eleven priority areas to be approved by the Prime Minister and the President As of 2011, district mayors from all over the country started to participate in Umwiherero, a move which improved the integration of local government in the process of knowledge exchange and communication at the retreat. Since 2011 the organisation, implementation, and outcomes of Umwiherero have vastly improved and significant achievements have been recorded. A shift in focus towards a smaller number of key priorities has made it easier for meaningful discussions to be had and for effective implementation to take place. For example, the number of national priorities agreed upon by participants fell from 174 in 2009 to 11 in 2010 and fell again to six in 2011. The retreats are also credited with significantly improving coordination and cooperation between government ministries and agencies.

The word Umuganda can be translated as ‘coming together in common purpose to achieve an outcome’. In traditional Rwandan culture, members of the community would call upon their family, friends and neighbors to help them complete a difficult task. 8. Overview 9. The word Umuganda can be translated as 'coming together in common purpose to achieve an outcome'. In Rwanda, traditionally members of the community would call upon their family, friends and neighbours to help them complete a difficult task. 10. Modern day Umuganda can be described as community work. On the last Saturday of each month, communities come together to do a variety of public works, which often include activities that promote infrastructure development and environmental protection. Rwandans between 18 and 65 are obliged to participate in these activities, and non-Rwandans living in Rwanda are encouraged to take part. 11. Today, according to the Ministry of local government, close to 90% of Rwandans take part in monthly community work. Projects undertaken during Umuganda may include the building of schools, medical centers and hydroelectric plants as well as rehabilitating wetlands and creating highly productive agricultural plots. The average annual value of Umuganda to the country’s development between 2014 and 2019 has been estimated at around 21 million USD. 12. Whilst the main purpose of Umuganda is to undertake community work, after this work finishes, community members then meet to discuss important matters. This meeting provides a platform for leaders at each level of government, from the village up to the national level, to inform citizens about important news and announcements. It also serves as a forum in which community members are able to discuss any problems they or the community are facing and propose solutions together. This time is used for evaluating what the community has achieved and for planning activities for the next Umuganda a month later. 13. Umuganda has contributed nearly 62% of the total cost of classrooms constructed during the implementation of the Nine and Twelve Years Basic Education (9 & 12 YBE) programme. 14. How does Umuganda work? 15. Organisation of Umuganda 16. The Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) is the central government authority responsible for Umuganda activities, but different ministries are also involved. 17. Coordination and Stakeholders 18. The relevant stakeholders to Umuganda include: the Umuganda Supervising Committees, local leaders and the communities themselves. 19. Umuganda Supervising Committees 20.There are Umuganda committees at the village, cell, sector, district, provincial and national levels, and the structure is shown in the table below. The umudugudu (village) level is responsible for building cooperation, collaboration and community solidarity, and all activities start at this level. 21. The role of the Umuganda Supervising Committees is to plan the community work, organise and supervise the community work activity, and carry out the evaluation of community work as well as make reports indicating the monetary value of the work. These committees also work with communities and jointly decide which activities are to be undertaken, notifying the relevant community seven days before the next Umuganda is about to take place. 22.Umuganda supervising committee structure STEERING COMMITTEE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL The role of the steering committee is to plan, assess and encourage members of the public to participate. This committee also publicises the results of Umuganda. The technical committee is responsible for coordinating, implementing, evaluating and developing umuganda programmes. AT THE PROVINCE AND CITY OF KIGALI LEVEL The Steering Committee at this level coordinates Umuganda activities that take place at the district level, evaluates and reports to the Supervising Committee at the national level, and encourages citizens to take part in community work. The Technical Committee analyses reports from the relevant districts and provides a summary to MINALOC. AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL Technical Committees prepare and supervise Umuganda, evaluate it and report to the Supervising Committee at the provincial or City of Kigali level. TECHNICAL COMMITTEES ALSO EXIST AT THE SECTOR, CELL AND VILLAGE LEVEL. 23.The Supervising Committee at the level at which the work was carried out must submit a report after the work has been completed. This report needs to indicate the monetary value of the work undertaken. 24.The Community Work Supervising Committee at the national level is required to submit a report to the Prime Minister every six months. Umuganda reports, regardless of the level at which they are produced, must include the number of people who participated in the work, the specific activities undertaken as well as their monetary value. 25. 26. 27.Local Leaders 28.The role of local leaders is to promote participation in Umuganda, set up maintenance mechanisms for activities achieved, promote the active involvement of women and young people, and strengthen Umuganda committees. 29.The community 30.Finally, the role of the community is to take ownership of planning and organizing Umuganda, to conduct the works and take ownership of activities achieved so that they can be sustained. 31. Those who are not able to participate for professional or personal reasons are obliged to inform the committee, which then passes this information to the relevant community. If community members do not participate when they are able to, the Supervising Committee may fine them. Any revenue from fines must be used to support community work. However, before a fine can be given, the committee must first talk to the person and encourage him or her to participate. 32. In 2009, the National Umuganda Competition was introduced to encourage proper reporting and to promote participation in Umuganda at all levels of Rwandan society. At the district level the best activity is awarded a certificate and funding for future projects. The best three projects in each province are awarded prizes. The best three projects from across Rwanda are awarded a cash prize. 33. Impact Umuganda is credited with contributing to Rwanda’s development, particularly in the areas of infrastructure development, environmental protection and good governance. Common infrastructure projects include roads (especially those connecting sectors), bridges, health centres, classroom construction (to support the 9 and 12 Years Basic Education programmes), housing construction for poor and vulnerable Rwandans (often to replace grass-thatched housing), and the construction of local government offices and savings and credit cooperative (SACCO) buildings. Contribution of citizens and government in the construction of 9 Years Basic Education classrooms RGB, the Assessment of the impact of Home Grown initiatives, Kigali, 2014 Environmental protection projects undertaken under Umuganda include tree planting and terracing to fight erosion, wetland rehabilitation, renewable energy construction and crop planting. The governance impact of Umuganda is diverse and includes, according the a 2014 survey conducted by Rwanda Governance Board, strengthened social cohesion between people from different backgrounds, increased opportunity for community members to articulate their needs and express their opinions on various issues, strengthened unity and reconciliation through the platform that Umuganda provides for conflict resolution between community members, increased opportunity for neighbourhood members to know each other and engage in friendships, increased mutual assistance in the community, and enhanced dialogue between national leaders and the population. The President of the Republic of Rwanda, members of Parliament and Ministers participate in the monthly community works together with the population, which promotes dialogue between national leaders and the population at the grassroots level. Umuganda is also an avenue for information sharing, through which many public policies are communicated and explained to the general population. The table below shows that participation in Umuganda rose form 78% in 2010/2011 to 91% in 2014/2015 and remained above 90% until 2019. The next table shows that the monetary value of Umuganda activities began at 7.3 billion RWF in 2010/2011 and rose every year, eventually reaching 22.8 billion RWF in 2018/2019. Government of Rwanda, 2020 Imihigo ECONOMY As part of efforts to reconstruct Rwanda and nurture a shared national identity, the Government of Rwanda drew on traditional practices in Rwandan culture to adapt its development programmes to the country’s needs and context. Overview Imihigo is the plural of the Kinyarwanda word Umuhigo, and is derived from the root, Higa, and the verb Guhiga, which means to vow to deliver, as well as Guhiganwa, which means to compete among one another. Imihigo was a precolonial cultural practice in Rwanda in which an individual would set targets or goals to be achieved within a specific period of time, most often, leaders and chiefs. The person would have to complete these objectives by following guiding principles, and was expected to be determined to overcome any possible challenges that arise. In the event that leaders and chiefs failed to achieve their stated objectives, they would face shame and embarrassment from the community. However, opinions vary on what constituted a traditional Imihigo. Some have recalled it as having a basis in war, whereby warriors would throw a spear into the ground while publicly proclaiming the feats they would accomplish in battle. In 2000, a decentralisation programme shifted the responsibilities of all levels of government, requiring a new approach to monitoring and evaluation. Local levels of government were now responsible for implementing development programmes which meant that the central government – as well as the people of Rwanda – needed a way to ensure accountability. In 2006, the Imihigo system (referred to in English as performance contracts) was reinstated by Rwanda’s President, Paul Kagame, as a result of concerns about the speed and quality of execution of government programmes and priorities. Today, Imihigo is used across government as a system of performance contracts and to ensure accountability. All levels of government, from the local district level to ministries and embassies, are required to develop their Imihigo and have them evaluated. Members of the civil service also sign Imihigo with their managers or head of institution. Whilst Imihigo is now widely used across government, it first began at the district level. When developing its Imihigo, each local government administrative unit determines its own objectives (with measurable indicators) taking into account national priorities as highlighted in the national and international policy and strategy documents such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Vision 2050, National Strategy for Transformation 1 (NST1), District Development Strategies (DDSs) and Sector Strategic Plans (SSPs). The Imihigo, are presented to the public for the purpose of accountability and transparency, during both planning and reporting phases. The mayors and province governors also sign the Imihigo or performance contracts with Rwanda’s President, which commit them to achieving certain agreed objectives. Since its introduction, Imihigo has been credited with: • Improving accountability, • Increasing the pace of citizen centered development activities and programs, • Ensuring the full participation and ownership of citizens because priorities are developed at the grassroots level. How the Imihigo performance contracts work How the Imihigo performance contracts work Principles and objectives of Imihigo Principles Imihigo is governed by the following principles: • Local: Each district decides what goes into its Imihigo. However, alignment with national priorities is required. • Ambition: Pledges are made to achieve only what has not already been achieved or gained. • Excellence: Imihigo is about driving outstanding performance that is worthy of praise. Objectives of Imihigo Imihigo has the following objectives: • To speed up implementation of the local and national development agenda • To ensure stakeholder ownership of the development agenda • To promote accountability and transparency • To promote results-oriented performance • To instill innovation and encourage competitiveness • To engage stakeholders (citizens, civil society, donors, private sector, etc.) in policy formulation and evaluation • To promote zeal and determination to achieve set goals • To instill a culture of regular performance evaluation The Imihigo preparation process Both Imihigo and action plans are used by the Government of Rwanda to define goals, targets and objectives. While different in their purpose, the two tools are interlinked. Action plans are sets of activities to be achieved within a set time period, usually a year. Imihigo are subsets of action plans showing priority activities to be used as a performance measure. An action plan may contain any number of activities of a routine nature such as payment of salaries, whereas Imihigo define targets that have a significant impact on economic development, poverty reduction, good governance and social welfare. When Imihigo are developed, government leaders are advised to ask some key questions before including activities in them. An activity is prioritised according to the following criteria: • Will the activity have a positive effect on the welfare of the local population (for example by improving water access, transport, energy access, schools, and so on)? • Will the activity create jobs for the local population? • Will the activity create opportunities for income generation for the population/local government? • Will the activity have an impact on poverty reduction? • Will the activity be a priority for the residents in the area? • Will the activity have synergy with development of other areas (an activity may have potential to impact development in neighbouring areas)? • Will the activity be sustainable or are the results sustainable? • Will there be ownership from the local population for the activity? • Will it help to achieve the national targets and is it linked to national and international priorities, programmes or policies (SDGs, NST1, Vision 2050)? • Can the activity produce quality results or outputs with minimum resources? • Can the activity improve the way services are delivered or reduce costs? • Will the activity promote social cohesion (unity and reconciliation)? • Will the activity reduce social disorder or unrest (for example, insecurity, drug abuse, prostitution, environmental degradation, conflicts, corruption, and so on)? • Will the activity address key cross-cutting issues (gender, HIV/AIDS, environment, social inclusion and youth)? • Has the source of funds for implementation been determined? • Is the activity realistic and can it be achieved? Step 1: Identification of national priorities by the central government In the first step of the Imihigo preparation process, each ministry identifies national priorities to be implemented at the local level, for which they have earmarked resources to be transferred to local governments. Consultation takes place on the following policies and programs: • Vision 2020/2050 • NST1 • Government of Rwanda policies and programmes • National Leadership Retreat and National Dialogue resolutions • Cabinet resolutions • Three Year Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) • DDSs • SDGs Where they do not have earmarked resources, line ministries identify how the resources, whether financial or non-financial, can be mobilised (at both national and local levels). The central government consolidates the priorities, paying special attention to areas with potential for quick wins and for synergy, whilst avoiding duplication. Step 2: Communication of national priorities to local government In the second step, the list of central government priorities is communicated and discussed with local government leaders at a forum of central and local government leaders. Step 3: Identification of local priorities In the third step, district leaders consult their DDS, and consultative meetings are held with different stakeholders at province level, as well as district, sector, cell and village levels, to discuss and consolidate the emerging priorities. Step 4: Preparation and approval The fourth step involves the preparation and approval of Imihigo contracts and proceeds as follows: • Districts consult their respective DDS and national priorities as communicated in the forum or meeting between central and local government • Local and national priorities are consolidated at the district level • For districts and provinces, the draft is discussed with a Quality Assurance Technical Team from the Ministry of Local Government and Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning • Priorities are presented to stakeholders • Priorities are then approved The Quality Assurance Technical Team was set up to assist the districts and provinces, including Kigali City, in preparing tangible Imihigo that respond to national targets. The Quality Assurance Technical Team is composed of members of the Imihigo evaluation team, the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO), the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) and Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) as well as all sector ministries that are part of decentralisation. The team gives regular feedback to district planners during the process of preparing Imihigo. District leaders are asked to prepare plans that are realistic, that take into account the cost of delivering services, and that align with the available resources. To make sure that proper monitoring and evaluation can be conducted, indicators, targets and outputs must be clearly identified in the planning process. When developing Imihigo, leaders are asked to take into account cross-cutting issues including gender, HIV/AIDS, environment, social inclusion and youth. Decision makers are encouraged to discuss these issues and involve relevant stakeholders to ensure that their Imihigo incorporate these aspects of development. Linkage of district plans to national planning and budgeting The key planning instruments used in Rwanda are the Vision 2050 strategy and NST1 which set out the government’s national objectives and socioeconomic transformation strategies. NST1 builds on previous medium-term development strategies by taking into account lessons learned and successes so far, as well as challenges previously encountered. It is the planning instrument tasked with enabling the transformation journey towards achieving Vision 2050 aspirations. The formulation of NST1 was guided by the following considerations: • Laying the foundation for Vision 2050 implementation and removing binding constraints to achieving the longer-term Vision 2050 targets • Adopting and scaling up HGI based on Rwandan culture, values, and the country’s unique developmental context • Further developing the private sector as the engine and driver of economic growth • Ensuring sustainability for long-lasting results • Ensuring inclusiveness for all to benefit without leaving anyone behind • Completing unfinished objectives from EDPRS 2 and Vision 2020 The strategy will be implemented and coordinated through the framework presented in Figure below. Framework governing Imihigo It is the central government’s role to ensure that national priorities are reflected in local government budgets through the allocation and transfer of earmarked grants and through the preparation of policy guidelines to local government for service provision. In addition, government ministries have an important role in monitoring and supporting local governments in the implementation of programmes and services. Monitoring and evaluation process Since 2006, Imihigo has been used by local government authorities at the district level for both planning and implementation of national programmes based on district priorities. After the success of the Imihigo programme at the district level, in 2009, Rwanda expanded the Imihigo programme downward and upward to cover almost the entire public sector. Below the district level, public officials from administrative sectors, cells and villages were included in the Imihigo programme. Administratively, each district in Rwanda is divided into sectors, each sector is divided into cells, and each cell is divided into villages. Above the district level, 18 ministries, 3 Boards (Rwanda Development Board (RDB), Rwanda Governance Board (RGB), Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board (RMPGB)) and the City of Kigali, signed up for Imihigo. Between 2006 to 2018, the monitoring and evaluation process consisted of local governments documenting all activities and expenses related to their Imihigo so that the central government could track progress. In addition, mayors would submit reports to the government explaining their progress in detail annually halfway through the year. At the end of every fiscal year, the national government would put together two sets of evaluation teams with members from: • the Ministry of Local Government, • the Prime Minister’s Office, • the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, • the Rwandan Association of Local Government Authorities, • the implementation secretariat, • civil society organizations. These two teams would travel around the country and visit all 30 districts of Rwanda to conduct two-day evaluations, whereby the districts' progress reports and audit supporting documentation would be collected. If there were discrepancies or delays in implementation, the mayors would be asked to justify the reasons by the evaluation teams. Lastly, the two teams would select Imihigo targets and check them personally. For instance, if an Umihigo (singular form of Imuhigo) was to build a new school with 50 classrooms, the evaluation team would visit the school, count the classrooms, and check if it met other specifications defined in the Umihigo target. The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) in charge of evaluation (2018) Between 2014 and 2018, the Institute for Policy Analysis and Research (IPAR), a Rwandan think-tank, led an evaluation of the Imihigo initiative. The revised evaluation methodology introduced different weights assigned to items in economic development, social development and accountable governance and considered citizen participation and satisfaction in the overall scores. As a result of the evaluation by IPAR, and to effectively deepen the links between Imihigo and the transformation of livelihoods of Rwandans, PMO requested that NISR evaluate Imihigo from 2018 onwards. This has resulted in refinement to the evaluation methodology to account for newly introduced aspects. In planning, Imihigo focus on transformative programs and projects with SMART indicators. It was expected that NISR would add value in terms of independence and objectivity, and would root the evaluation in a more rigorous evidence-based approach. The mixing of routine activities and more impactful outcomes in Imihigo had created a problem. Administrative processes such as writing official letters and reports, which were considered in the final evaluation, sometimes came at the expense of more impactful activities such as completing the building of classrooms. Assessing the utilisation of time and the quality of completion of activities was also a problematic exercise. Finally, the attachment of Imihigo to individual entities had resulted in a narrowing of institutions’ focus to results for which they are accountable under these performance contracts. This created a gap in attention and accountability for key strategic results at national level that may not be assigned to a single institution but which have greater impact on the transformational agenda of Rwanda. To address these issues, under NIRS guidance, the planning of Imihigo focus on transformative programs and projects with SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely) indicators. SMART targets: Under NISR’s evaluation approach, Imihigo are to focus on key national programmes and projects that are transformative and SMART. Other routine projects and programmes will be considered and evaluated under action plans. Moreover, activities in both Imihigo and action plans will be evaluated and their respective shares reflected in the overall score. With regard to implementation, the focus will be on 1) timeliness of completion and 2) quality of implemented projects. Joint and individual Imihigo: Imihigo were divided into two categories: the joint Imihigo and individual Imihigo. Joint Imihigo are sector-specific and are set and implemented in the context of a partnership between ministries and districts to deliver certain projects. In some instances, that partnership may involve the private sector. Projects implemented by means of joint Imihigo are mainly in the agriculture, urbanisation and human settlement, social protection, service delivery, energy, job creation and export sectors. Meanwhile individual Imihigo are those that are set and implemented by a single government entity. Output and outcome Imihigo: The 2014 National Leadership Retreat decided to strengthen focus of individual and institutional Imihigo on outcomes rather than outputs. Output Imihigo focus on physical products or projects that can deliver outcome or impact only when completed. Most outputs can be physically verified and counted, and cannot be put to use unless the Imihigo have been completed. Examples of outputs include classrooms, health facilities, and markets. If such facilities are completed, they score 100 percentage points. If they are not completed on time, they score 0 percentage points during evaluation exercises. On the other hand, outcome Imihigo pertain to activities the results of which can add value at the same time as they are being implemented. Examples include access to electricity and to health insurance. During evaluation exercises they are scored based on the results achieved up to that point. The expansion the of Imihigo evaluation Prior to 2009, the Imihigo was only applied at the district level, but today it has expanded to: • All 30 districts, Kigali City, 19 ministries and 3 boards (parastatals) are evaluated every year by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) • At the local levels below the sector level, Imihigo are managed by the district, which sets up the planning, reporting, evaluation guidelines and timelines consistent with the higher-level framework.

National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda 3 Boards Rwanda Development Board/ Rwanda Governance Board/ Rwanda Mines, Petroleum & Gas Board National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda Overview Ubudehe SOCIAL WELFARE Ubudehe refers to the long-standing Rwandan practice and culture of collective action and mutual support to solve problems within a community. The focus of traditional Ubudehe was mostly on cultivation. Overview Ubudehe refers to the long-standing Rwandan cultural practice of collective action and mutual support to solve problems within the community. The focus of traditional Ubudehe was mostly on cultivation. Today, Ubudehe is a Government of Rwanda poverty reduction initiative which provides communities with the skills and support necessary to engage in problem- solving and decision-making for their development. The programme helps citizens to use local institutions to achieve goals set by the community. Ubudehe was reintroduced into Rwandan life in 2001, as a way of strengthening democratic processes and good governance through greater community involvement in decision-making. Ubudehe creates opportunities for people at all levels of society, especially the village level, to interact with one another, share ideas, create institutions and make decisions for their collective development. Ubudehe is one of Rwanda’s best known Home Grown Initiatives (HGI) because of its participatory development approach to poverty reduction. In 2008, the programme won the United Nations Public Service Award for excellence in service delivery. Today, Ubudehe is one of the country’s core development programmes. How does Ubudehe work? How does Ubudehe work? The objectives of Ubudehe: • To assist community members to classify the level and type of poverty that exists in their community and reach a common understanding of this classification • To help communities to define their development priorities • To bring communities together to discuss and decide upon the most effective and efficient ways to achieve poverty reduction and their development priorities • To help communities to establish ways of funding their development plans, at both the individual and group levels To achieve these aims, participating villages across Rwanda come together over a period of four to seven days, at a convenient time such as after farming activities, to complete the Ubudehe process. This process takes place at the beginning of the financial year. Meetings are chaired by the president of the local Ubudehe Committee and the village leader. They usually last for three hours each day. Ubudehe takes place at both the umudugudu (village), and household level through similar processes. The following steps are carried out every two years: • Determine the profile of a household in poverty, as perceived by the people themselves • Determine the causes and consequences of poverty • Draw up the social map of the cell showing the names of household heads, their social category (different categories are again decided by the people themselves) and development infrastructure The following steps are carried out every year: • Identify and analyse the problems facing the community and determine a priority problem to be addressed • Plan the activities and resources needed for addressing the prioritized problem through a collective action plan (Ubudehe) • Put in place a system to manage the identified collective action • Submit the action plan to an applicability test for all stakeholders to see if the proposed strategies in the plan are the best to solve the problem that was identified • Check whether Ubudehe principles are respected • The management committee (which is elected by the community), local technicians, local authorities and other stakeholders, approve the execution of the collective action and engage to safeguard and respect the principles of collective action • After this process, funds are made available to support the identified Ubudehe collective action The model household to assist One household is chosen to undergo the Ubudehe process to assist it in overcoming poverty. The purpose of singling out one household is to provide the community with a model that can be followed. The household’s coping strategies are analyzed before the following process is undertaken with the assistance of trained Ubudehe facilitators: 1. Determine the household’s coping strategies throughout the year 2. Analyse these strategies in order to come up with a plan to improve the household’s living conditions 3. Plan activities and budget the necessary means to execute the strategy 4. A compatibility test is then carried out by people of integrity in the community (inyangamugayo) to make sure that the chosen strategy is appropriate and useful to the household 5. The household members finally accept and sign for the funds that are accorded to them. A key part of Ubudehe is that the residents of a community define the levels of poverty that exist in their village. This process takes place every two years and the information is used to decide development priorities as well as who should benefit from other social security programs and HGI such as Umuganda and Girinka. Poverty level categories Poverty level categories The Ubudehe process involves categorising all households into one of a range of appropriate categories of poverty level; however, these categories changed over time as described in this section. Ubudehe categories up to 2015 There were six Ubudehe poverty categories from inception until February 2015 which were as follows: • Abatindi nyakujya (Those living in abject poverty): This category of the population owned no property, lived by begging and was wholly dependent on others. • Abatindi (Very poor): This category of the population had poor housing, lived on a poor diet, depended on others and did not own land or livestock. • Abakene (Poor): This category of the population was malnourished, owned a small portion of land, had low production capacity and could not afford secondary school education for their children. • Abakene bifashije (Resourceful poor): This category of the population owned some land, cattle and a bicycle, and had average production capacity. They could afford secondary school education for their children and had fewer difficulties accessing health care. • Abakungu - jumba (Food rich): This category of the population owned a large portion of land, could afford a balanced diet and lived in decent houses. They employed others, owned cattle, and could afford university education for their children. • Abakire (Money rich): This category of the population had money in bank account(s), could receive bank loans, owned an above-average house, a car, cattle and fertile land, and had access to sufficient food and permanent employment. 2015 Ubudehe categorization In February 2015, the Minister for Local Government and Social Affairs launched a new categorisation for Ubudehe. One reason was that since the previous categorisation, many Rwandan households’ economic situations had risen dramatically, requiring a recategorisation. Another reason was that under the previous categorisation system, many households resisted being properly classified due to the derogatory names attached to the different levels, distorting the categorisation process. There were now four Ubudehe poverty categories which started in February 2015; these were as follows: • Category 1: Very poor and vulnerable citizens who were homeless and unable to feed themselves without assistance. • Category 2: Citizens who were able to afford some form of rented or lowclass owned accommodation, but who were not gainfully employed and could only afford to eat once or twice a day. • Category 3: Citizens who were gainfully employed or were even employers of labour. This category included small farmers who had moved beyond subsistence farming, or owners of small and medium-scale enterprises. • Category 4: Citizens classified under this category were Chief Executive Officers of big businesses, employees who had full-time employment with organisations, industries or companies, government employees, owners of shops or markets and owners of commercial transport vehicles or trucks. These categories were subject to constant appeals and complaints from people who wanted to be placed in lower categories, some using bribery and nepotism to attain their goal. The 2015 categorisation provided weak implementation frameworks for users of social programmes. It was marred by over-dependency on the government, and slow graduation of communities from poverty. Ubudehe categories from 2020 onwards The new 2020 categorisation attempts to fairly re-classify households according to their socioeconomic status. A common complaint was that households with different welfare levels were classified in the same category; another was that households in category 1 and 2 had almost the same standards of living. The new Ubudehe approach puts emphasis on the graduation principle, fostering upward social mobility. The new model seeks to be cost-effective, evenly spreads resources, and assigns roles and tasks across all categories. Category names have also been changed from numerical numbers to letters. The 2020 Ubudehe Categories • A & B: These categories of households have diverse life choices and are self-reliant in ways that can also spur community empowerment and help other households graduate from poverty. Households in categories A and B do not benefit from social protection schemes but are expected to be partners in community development through their own investments and skills, which can create jobs through application of corporate social responsibility principles. • C & D: these two categories are self-reliant households but that also benefit from social protection interventions and multi-sectoral interventions; but to do so they must also sign performance contracts (Imihigo) containing a plan for graduation from this assistance within a period of 2 years. These categories will have graduation as the main focus. • Special category (E): This category of households is expected to benefit from full state social protection; individuals in this category are not expected to graduate and will thus not be obliged to sign performance contracts. This is a new category; those in it may be aged, vulnerable or may have no skills to pursue any job. These households will benefit from full state social protection, accessing everything from the Vision 2020 Umurenge programme, subsidies for solar-based domestic electrical systems, Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI), fortified blended foods, Girinka, and other schemes. • ENG • / • FR • Umuganda • What are HGI • Organization and coordination • Ubudehe is a highly decentralised programme based at the village level, and as a result is implemented and monitored by the administrative entities at that level. • At the national level, the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) and the Local Administrative Entities Development Agency (LODA) are responsible for overseeing the implementation of Ubudehe. They work with leaders at all levels of government, especially the village level, to ensure the effective functioning of the programme. • To facilitate the programme, Ubudehe Committees at each administrative level are established. • Once a community has decided which project they will undertake at a general meeting, validation must take place at the district level. • Funds are then transferred to the sector level; the sector then distributes the money into the village’s Ubudehe bank account which is usually located at Savings and Credit Cooperative Organisations (SACCOs) or at the Banque Populaire du Rwanda (BPR). The village level Ubudehe Committee is then responsible for accessing and dispersing the funds to suppliers. • • Impact ENG / FR Umuganda What are HGI Impact Ubudehe has resulted in significant achievements for poor households. These include the following: • Improved incomes • Greater capacity to pay for food expenses • Greater capacity to pay for school expenses • Greater capacity to pay for health expenses • Increased capacity to renovate houses • Strengthened intra-community bonds of friendship and solidarity Community-level benefits of Ubudehe include the following: • The promotion of livestock rearing (and associated dietary benefits and income growth) • The construction and repair of rural roads and other infrastructure • Together, households have increased economic demand for local businesses • Improved agricultural development due to increased investment by poor households in agricultural inputs such as fertilisers and improved seeds • The construction of administrative infrastructure such as office buildings to alleviate shortages of such spaces Overall, Ubudehe has caused a sharp increase in participation in economic activities by the poor, as shown in the figure below, leading to substantial and sustained improvements in welfare. One of the most significant impacts of Ubudehe is the way in which it has transformed citizens' engagement with their own development. Ubudehe has achieved almost nationwide coverage and communities across Rwanda are now actively involved in developing their own social maps, visual representations, and collection of data on the extent of poverty in their village. This information is used to determine national development objectives against which the national government and its ministries are held accountable. The way in which Ubudehe has brought communities together for collective action based on their own priorities is also considered a major achievement of the programme. The provision of a bank account to each community has facilitated thousands of community-led actions such as purchasing livestock, undertaking agricultural activities, building clean water facilities, classrooms, terraces, health centers as well as silos for storing produce. PROJECTS FINANCED BY THE UBUDEHE PROGRAMME FROM 2001 TO DATE The projects are divided into two categories: Community Projects and household Projects; Each village is required to implement one Household Project and one Community Project Merging the projects is allowed and villages can merge together and implement one project at cell or sector level Though the Ubudehe Programme, 89,937 Community projects were financed and 94,322 Household projects were financed with funds totaling Rwf 44,408,541,122. The Ubudehe programme has been, and continues to be, a major contributor to overall poverty reduction in Rwanda, in which extreme poverty reduced from 24% to 16% between 2010/2011 and 2016/2017, and the general poverty rate reduced from 45% in 2010/2011 to 38% in 2016/2017. However, Ubudehe has had more than just an economic impact, it has also had an impact on access to health, education and shelter, as well as improved nutrition, social cohesion and self-governance. Girinka SOCIAL WELFARE As part of efforts to reconstruct Rwanda and nurture a shared national identity, the Government of Rwanda drew on traditional practices in Rwandan culture to adapt its development programmes to the country’s needs and context. Overview As part of efforts to reconstruct Rwanda and nurture a shared national identity, the Government of Rwanda drew on traditional practices in Rwandan culture to adapt its development programmes to the country’s needs and context. The result is a set of Home Grown Initiatives (HGI), which are culturally owned practices that translate into sustainable development programs. One of these is the One Cow per Poor Family program, known as Girinka in Kinyarwanda. The 2005 Demographic and Health Survey report showed that 45% of children under five years of age suffered from moderate chronic malnutrition and 19% suffered from severe malnutrition. Almost no progress had been made since the previous survey in 2000. In addition, the 2005-6 Household Living Conditions Survey showed that poverty had actually increased since 2001. These results came as a shock, since the country had embarked on a sustained socioeconomic development drive launched by the adoption and the launch of Vision 2020 in 2000 and Rwanda’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper in 2002, marking the beginning in earnest of its post-genocide socioeconomic reconstruction. During the December 2006 Umushyikirano (National Dialogue Council) retreat, leaders discussed this grim socioeconomic situation, deciding to adopt a policy to distribute cows to poor households to combat child malnutrition. The scheme was later developed by the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB) and named Girinka, a term that can be loosely translated as “may you have a cow”. It is also a mode of greeting in Kinyarwanda in which someone wishes another person to prosper. The idea of distributing cows to the poor initially sought to respond specifically to the challenge of child malnutrition, but it also drew inspiration from the Rwandan traditional practice of giving a cow as a sign of friendship, appreciation or as a marriage dowry. Naturally, Girinka joined other existing HGI. As of June 2020, more than 380,000 families had received a cow under the Girinka program, thus benefiting over 1.2 million Rwandans. Girinka has also contributed to an increase in agricultural production in Rwanda, especially milk products which have helped to reduce malnutrition and increase incomes. How does Girinka works? How Girinka works The programme is structured in two phases: 1. A community member who would greatly benefit from owning a cow is identified, and is given a pregnant dairy cow. That person benefits from the cow’s milk and manure production. 2. The beneficiary is then obliged to give the first born female calf to another worthy beneficiary in their community. This is known as the ‘pass on’ principle, or Kuziturirana/Kwitura. Girinka has been described as a culturally-inspired form of social safety net because of the way it introduces a productive asset (a dairy cow) which can provide long-term benefits to the recipient. The Government of Rwanda was initially the sole funder of the Girinka programme, but development partners have since become involved. Institutional arrangement of Girinka Girinka has a focus on a decentralised approach which means that each of Rwanda’s 30 districts is responsible for implementing much of the programme. However, RAB, an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for coordinating the activities of Girinka at the national level. Each of Rwanda’s districts has a RAB focal person who liaises with sector and district veterinary officers, selection officers, local administration and the Girinka programme coordinator. They are also involved in local level implementation, including distribution of cows, beneficiary training and informing farmers of the benefits of working with milk collection centres and milk processing factories. Monitoring and evaluation is done in partnership with local government units such as the umurenge (sector), akagali (cell) and umudugudu (village). Before and after a beneficiary receives a cow either directly or via the ‘pass on’ principle, RAB district and sector veterinary officers provide support in primary animal care through training, veterinary services, artificial insemination, fodder seeds and plant materials for animal feeds as well as vaccination against diseases. The aim of this aspect of the programme is to equip families with the animal husbandry skills to care for the cow themselves. How beneficiaries can receive cows The two ways that a beneficiary can receive a cow are: Girinka y’ingabirano (donation): A poor family receives a heifer by way of donation. When a cow gives birth, the first female calf is given to a neighbour or community member. Once that cow gives birth, its first female calf is given to the next selected beneficiary and so on. This ‘pass on’ practice is called kuziturirana. If a male calf is born, the beneficiary may sell it and use the funds to buy a female calf to pass on. Girinka y’inguzanyo (loan): A bank loan is given to a family to buy a cow. The beneficiary must meet certain criteria including being able to care for the animal, construct a cow shed and own sufficient land to support the cow. Funding Funding is provided by the Government of Rwanda, non-governmental organizations and private citizens. For example, under the Dairy Cattle Development Support Project (PADEBL), the African Development Fund contributed 8,200 local breed cattle and 3,000 crossbred cattle to Girinka. Once the programme budget has been allocated in the overall national budget, or donations have been received, RAB coordinates the process of purchasing heifers. Efforts have been made to decentralise the programme and allocate the bulk of the programme budget to local government units. Private donations are processed through RAB and are governed by the Ministerial Decentralisation Guidelines. In these cases, donors can set their own criteria for receiving the heifer, but RAB must certify that cows are healthy before they can be given to beneficiaries. Selection of cows Cows are purchased through an open tender process managed by RAB at the national level and by local government at the district level. Before a cow can be purchased from a supplier or accepted as a donation, RAB first conducts a series of veterinary medical examinations to ensure the cow is: • Healthy and free from contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and brucellosis • Physically sound • Between 18-24 months old and weighs at least 250kgs • Pregnant or at the age of insemination • At least 50% of the cow’s genetic makeup must be from a non-local breed such as a Friesian or Jersey Priority is given to purchasing cows from Girinka beneficiaries whose original cows have calved more than once and have thus implemented the ‘pass on’ principle. Selection of beneficiaries In accordance with the principles of the Ubudehe programme, the local community meets to decide which members should benefit from Girinka (and other social security programmes). To qualify as a beneficiary of Girinka, individuals or households must meet the following conditions: • The beneficiary must not already own a cow • The beneficiary must have constructed a cow shed • The beneficiary must have between 0.25 – 0.75 hectares of land, some of which must be planted with fodder • The beneficiary must be an Inyangamugayo (person of integrity) in the community • The beneficiary must be considered poor by the community and must have no other source of income Beneficiaries who do not have enough land individually may join with others in the community to build a common cow shed (ibikumba) for their cows. Preparation and training of beneficiaries Before beneficiaries receive a heifer, they undergo a training programme run by RAB. The training includes a workshop covering the five pillars of involvement in the programme and beneficiaries are provided with supplies (including drugs, spray pumps and mineral blocks) to assist them in caring for their cow. Selection officers, sector and district veterinary officers and local-level focal people are also involved in the training programme. Regular training and support to a beneficiary continues until their cow calves. The training given to the beneficiaries is based on the following five pillars: • Breeding • Nutrition • Housing • Health • Management and record keeping Distribution of cows to beneficiaries Leaders at the sector level are responsible for assessing how many cows can be distributed given the available budget and the number of Girinka cows likely to calve in that community. Once they have finalised the beneficiaries for the year, and beneficiaries have completed the training and constructed a cowshed, delivery is facilitated by RAB. Impact of Girinka The Girinka programme has led to a number of significant changes in the lives of the poorest Rwandans. The impact of Girinka can be divided into five categories: • Agricultural production • Food security • Livestock ownership • Health outcomes • Social cohesion Agricultural production Girinka has contributed to an increase in agricultural production in Rwanda. For example, milk production has risen due to an increase in the number of cows in the country and because beneficiaries have received crossbreeds with better productive capacity than local cattle species. Between 2010 and 2019 milk production increased by 119%, from 372,619 litres in 2010 to 816,000 litres in 2019. The construction of milk collection centres has also increased and by 2019, there were more than 126 centres operational nationwide. Most beneficiaries produce enough milk to sell some at market, providing additional cash income. The manure produced by the cows increases the productivity of beneficiaries’ crops, which enhances their food production and income. Girinka has also allowed beneficiaries to diversify crop production, leading to greater food security. Food security Food insecurity decreased in Rwanda from 28% in 2006 to 19% in 2018, according to Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analyses. A number of studies establish a direct link between a decrease in food insecurity and households receiving a Girinka cow, especially in reduction in stunting in children. Health outcomes The Girinka programme has played some part in reducing the level of malnutrition across the population, as well as among children under five. According to the Demographic Health Survey of 2020, the percentage of stunted children fell from 51% in 2005, to 33% in 2020; in the same period the percentage of wasted children fell from 5% to 1% percent and the percentage of underweight children fell from 18% to 6. Social cohesion Girinka has played an important role in post-genocide reconstruction in Rwanda. During the colonial period, the cow was used to divide Rwandans along ethnic lines and cattle became a symbol of elitism and a commodity reserved only for a specific portion of the country’s people. This distorted meaning was promoted by successive post-colonial governments as part of divisive and ethnic-based policies. According to a report by UNICEF, 90% of the country’s cattle were killed during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, associated as they were with one group. It is against this historical background that Girinka was introduced. Girinka has changed what it means to own cattle in Rwanda. While the symbolism of prosperity is still attached to the cow, by giving cattle to the poorest in society, the programme has helped to end the divisive perception surrounding owning cattle. The ‘pass on’ component of Girinka, whereby a recipient gifts the first born calf to a neighbour, has helped to rebuild social relationships destroyed during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. This is because the giving of a cow to someone or Gutanga Inka, which translates as ‘sealing a bond of friendship’, remains a cultural practice which is owned, understood and valued by Rwandans. Girinka also plays a significant role in reintegrating sensitive groups such as former inmates convicted of genocide into society. A particularly high proportion of this group have reported that receiving a cow from Girinka helped them escape from poverty and raised their social status in the community."
