        "prompt": " Summary of the 5-year Government Program/Second National Strategy for Transformation (NST2:2024 – 2029) I. Background, Rationale and Methodology for NST 2 elaboration Rwanda is implementing the long-term Vision 2050 to transform the country through a series of medium-term national development strategies aimed at ensuring the country achieves the two overarching goals of the Vision namely: (i) economic growth and prosperity; (ii) high quality of life for Rwandans. The National Strategy for Transformation (NST1, 2017- 2024), which is the first in the series of national development strategies designed to implement the Vision is well into its final year, necessitating the elaboration of a successor strategy (NST2). The second generation of the NST is expected to provide strategic guidance to national development for the next five years from 2024 to 2029 and drive the country towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals as well as the Vision 2050 (especially mid-term targets of 2035). The NST2 elaboration process has been widely consultative involving various stakeholders and the submitted document to Cabinet is the NST 2 Summary, more details on implementation will be captured in the NST2 full version and Sector Strategic Plans (SSPs). II. NST2 Strategic Orientation NST2 is designed to deliver the following transformative priorities: creating decent jobs with a particular emphasis on youth and women, boosting exports, reducing stunting and malnutrition, improving the quality of education and enhancing public service delivery and citizen participation. To effectively implement these priorities, several key enablers will be emphasized, including enhancing productivity through technology and digitalization, leveraging data and research, and fostering capacity development alongside public sector reforms. III. NST2 Macroeconomic Outlook NST2 targets an ambitious average annual real GDP growth of 9.3% over the five-year period. This growth trajectory anticipates productivity improvements across all sectors, with a shift towards value-added activities, particularly in agriculture, industry, and manufacturing, as well as in the job-intensive services sector, driven by innovation and increased private investment. Consequently, during the NST2 period, agriculture is expected to grow at average rates above 6%, while both industry and services are projected to grow at rates exceeding 10%. IV.
