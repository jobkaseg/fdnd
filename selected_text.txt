Selected Text: Rwanda
Correction: Rwanda is a country located in East Africa known for its stunning landscapes, wildlife, and vibrant culture. It is also sadly known for the genocide that took place in 1994, where an estimated 800,000 people were killed in just 100 days. Despite this dark chapter in its history, Rwanda has made significant progress in reconciliation and rebuilding, and is now considered one of the safest and most stable countries in Africa.
