Executive summary \n \nThe distortions of our culture during the colonial times resulted into the breakdown in our social fabric, mutual support and selfless service to the Nation that people used to be educated and practiced. Since 1994, the culture of volunteerism has been manifested in the Rwandan society in different sectors. Groups such as mediators; Gacaca courts’ judges, community health workers, national youth council members, national women council members and local government council members are a few examples of voluntary services acts that need special recognition for their contribution to the rebuilding of Rwanda. These are groups of people who have served the nation voluntarily in different capacities. In order to enhance the culture of volunteerism targeting different categories of the population in a structured manner, the government of Rwanda has established ITORERO to inspire positive values among Rwandans and to strengthen the volunteerism efforts already going on. Though the contribution of the groups mentioned above was not viewed in the perspective of National Service (URUGERERO), it can be categorised as Community Service (UBUKORERABUSHAKE). The work of these groups are inspired by our cultural values and all efforts to institute a structured National Service (URUGERERO) and community Service (UBUKORERABUSHAKE) Programs will build on them. The National Service (URUGERERO) Program is provided for in Art. 47 of the constitution of Rwanda which provides that, the establishment and functioning of National Service (URUGERERO) shall be determined by organic law. Through ITORERO and similar initiatives, the government is re-introducing the culture of serving the country at no financial reward to encourage patriotism, positive values, responsibility and selfless service - attributes that contribute to accelerating progress, promote social cohesion, peace and reconciliation and democratic governance. A review of the models employed by 7 other countries has been done to get their experiences and lessons but contextualised to our own situation. Most of the models reviewed target young people in the age range of 18 – 22 with a few going up to 30 years of age and only one country reaching 40 years. They also differ in terms of having the service as voluntary or mandatory with 3 of them making it mandatory and the other 3 making it voluntary. One country adopted a mixed approach for different categories of the population. The proposed model for Rwanda is also a blend of the two models where National Service (URUGERERO) will be obligatory for 18-35 youth. The other categories of the population will participate on a voluntary basis depending on their time. The National Service (URUGERERO) component is divided into two parts; a compulsory part and a voluntary part. Service programs are based on National priorities that are identified way before the commencement of the service. Strategic choices i.e. vision, goal, objectives to respond to the identified challenges are described to guide all the programming processes of the ITORERO programs. A motto for the URUGERO has been proposed which states “Selfless service to the Nation”. A symbol, a budget and the uniform of the National Service (URUGERERO) will be proposed by the steering committee of ITORERO and adopted by the cabinet. In order to develop and support the promotion of positive values and service programs in which all Rwandans can participate, an implementation and coordination framework has been developed. \n \nITORERO Commission is established to play the role of Planning, implementation and coordination of all ITORERO Programs in partnership with relevant stakeholders. The headquarters of the Commission will be in Kigali and will have a branch in Nkumba specifically concerned with the training of leadership groups. Plans that suit the needs of different categories of the population participating in ITORERO will be developed based on the identified service priorities and available resources. The strategy defines the phases of ITORERO i.e. mobilization and training, placement/serving, and graduation which will also include the recognition of best performers. The funding of the ITORERO will primarily be government responsibility but other partners will be encouraged to join and mobilize resources for the programs. Beneficiary institutions/organization of National Service (UREGERERO); whether government or others will contribute money for the basic needs where applicable. Different stakeholders will be engaged from time to time to bring their contribution and expertise to enrich the program. \n \nA monitoring and evaluation system will be developed and capacity building of ITORERO staff and stakeholders will be done to ensure that the system works effectively. Participatory method of monitoring, evaluation and reporting is encouraged to ensure that all stakeholders own the processes and the product and as a way of building their capacity in these functions. \n \n2. Context analysis \n \nPre-colonial African societies relied on mutual aid, kinship and community support to meet human needs. Traditional cultural beliefs and practices encouraged collective responsibility, solidarity and reciprocity (CSD Research report no.07-19, 2007). They have roots in social development approaches, which are mainly concerned with harmonising economic and social policies and programmes. They are culturally appropriate and context specific programs that promote people-centred development, human capabilities, social capital, participation and active citizenship, and civic engagement in achieving human development. \n \nBefore the colonial period, all Rwandans used to live harmoniously in the same community as a result of the Rwandan school known as “ITORERO”- a channel through which the nation could convey the messages to the people regarding national culture in different areas such as language, patriotism, social relations, sports, dance, songs and the defence of the nation. As a result young citizens could grow with an understanding and attachment to their culture. Participants were encouraged to discuss different national programs and the positive values of Rwandan culture. The ITORERO tradition also provided the formative training for leaders of the nation. Participants understood that cultural values could help them develop their judgment, psychology, work and mutual aid, life and collaborative relationships. \n \nWhen the colonizers arrived in Rwanda, they found Rwanda’s leadership very strong and their first mandate of colonization was to suppress the ITORERO by changing its mission to focus only on dancing. This situation impacted on relationships among Rwandans and the way the country was governed; discrimination and genocide ideology spread. As a consequence, Rwandan society was destroyed and many Rwandans fled the country to live in exile. The ultimate consequence of all this was the 1994 genocide perpetrated against Tutsis in which more than one million people died and left a society of poor and disabled people as well as a big number of refugees. Today, Rwanda’s socio-political history and geographical setting necessitates a socioeconomic and value system that guarantee the existence of the nation by its own people. \n \nRwanda aims to ensure human security, which goes beyond military considerations and includes all aspects of the community life i.e. economic, social, political and environmental security. In addition to developing the nation socially and economically, Rwanda also looks back to its pre-colonial roots to reiterate cultural values and norms and to protect itself against genocide ideology. \n \nAs a nation, we are looking to the population especially the youth to move the country forward and provide a solid base for future development. As a result of the distortions highlighted above, Rwandans especially the youth face the following challenges: \n \n Low levels of social cohesion/engagement \n Lack of values that help to promote positive attributes of our culture and that help people especially the youth to grow up as responsible and productive citizens \n Low levels of patriotism \n Low levels of awareness on unity and reconciliation \n High levels of both unemployment and underemployment \n Need for increased skills development across the board \n Overall low levels of education \n High risk of contracting HIV/AIDS & STDS \n Overpopulation – Rwanda has a high birth rate and is already densely populated \n Low levels of entrepreneurship and high level of dependency \n \nAfter 1994, the Government of Rwanda put in place structures to promote social cohesion among Rwandans with the aim of re-building a Rwandan society based on positive values of our culture, patriotism, truth, tolerance, respect, mutual support and democratic governance. \n \nThe culture of volunteerism has been re-introduced and re-enforced in the Rwandan society in different sectors. Groups such as mediators; Gacaca courts judges, community health workers, national youth council members, national women council members and local government council members etc need special recognition for their contribution to the rebuilding of Rwanda. These are groups of people who have served the nation voluntarily in different capacities. In order to enhance the culture of volunteerism targeting different categories of the population in a structured manner, the government of Rwanda has established National Service (URUGERERO) program as part of ITORERO ry’Igihugu to strengthen the volunteerism efforts already going on. Though the contribution of the groups mentioned above was not viewed in the perspective of National Service, it can be categorised as such and all efforts to institute a structured National Service (URUGERERO) Program will build on these. The National Service (URUGERERO) Program is provided for in Art. 47 of the constitution of Rwanda which states that; the establishment and functioning of National Service shall be determined by organic law \n \nThe ITORERO is striving to harness Rwandans and support them in addressing the challenges highlighted above. The Program will develop the participants individually and instill in them a culture of togetherness and commitment of service to their motherland. Such desires are achievable by voluntary participation in a disciplined population through a well organised National Service (URUGERERO) Program. \n \n3. Experience from other Countries \n \nThe training component (Gutozwa) of ITORERO is unique to Rwanda because it is based on our traditional norms and values but the Urugerero component has similarities with models being implemented by other countries. The development of the National Service (URUGERERO) Program component of ITORERO Strategy is informed by the experiences of other countries. Though contexts differ, lessons from the other countries implementing similar programs have been useful in shaping the ideas in this strategy document. Below is a summary of different models employed by different countries: \n \n3.1. Nigeria’s Model \n \nThe NS is obligatory for all graduates (home or abroad), Service is 1 year long split into 4 sections – training, primary assignment, community development service, passing out parade. The program involves both men and women and deployment is outside area of residence. The government works in partnership with lots of international agencies e.g. US embassy, DFID, UNESCO, WHO, etc, specific community development placements run alongside and are agreed by the community and are an addition to the programme. High performers are recognised at the pass out ceremony; uniform, monthly allowances, transport allowance to and from deployment region, local transport allowance are provided to participants. Participants are under 30 years and have not served in the armed forces or various other government agencies before. \n \n3.2. Kenya’s Model \n \nNS is voluntary and targets men and women in the age range 18 -22 years– fit, unmarried and without dependents, paramilitary training is provided and participants have to support the army if necessary. Participation can last up to two years and takes 10,000 participants per intake and work on projects of national importance – mainly construction. No payment but provided with free accommodation, meals, clothing and medical services and also covered against occupational hazards At the end of service participants can take up free trade training which only takes up to 3,500 technically qualified people each year. \n \n3.3. Namibia’s Model \n \nThe NS is voluntary targeting men and women in the age range of 18-29 and their participation goes up to 6 months divided in three phases – civic education (3 months), public sector service (3 months), skills training (variable depending on choice of the participant). The program takes in 1,000 participants per year divided into two sessions of 500 participants each. Participants are provided with food, accommodation, clothing, free health care and insurance and receive a monthly allowance. \n \n3.4. Ghana’s Model \n \n The NS of Ghana is obligatory targeting university graduates under 40 years old (men and women). The length of service is between 8 months to 1 year and areas of services are based on public need. Persons who have done a one-year non graduate course are required to undertake a oneyear post tertiary service. Ghanaians leaving abroad are also required to serve after they have completed their education in the other countries. \n \n3.5. Cameroon’s Model \n \nStill in the process of development but the proposed approach highlights the following aspects; the service will be obligatory for youth in the age range of 16-21 years and voluntary for other categories of the population aged 22 years and above. The number of participants proposed is 5,000 for the compulsory category and the duration of service is 3 months with possibility of prolongation to a maximum of 1 year. \n \n3.6. South Africa \n \nSouth Africa’s NS is still under construction but the pilot was initially focussing only on unemployed youth. But the focus is changing to four key target groups: students from secondary and tertiary institutions, unemployed young people and youth in conflict with the law not exceeding 17 years old. South Africa’s NS is adopting a combined model of voluntary and compulsory for different categories of participants but these categories are not specified yet. The program targets youth in the age range of 15 – 35 for those in high school, tertiary education, unemployed youth and 15 -17 years for those in conflict with the law. \n \n3.7. Israel Model \n \nThe NS is voluntary targeting young people in the age range of 18-22 who may include; high school drop outs, marginal youth, disabled and unemployed youth. The length of service for participants is from one year to two years. The volunteers receive monetary as well as non-monetary compensation. The financial ones may include: \n \n Stipend (pocket money). \n Cost of transportation. \n Housing costs and utilities. \n Bonus at the end of service. \n Reduced tuition. \n Benefits in mortgages and allocation of land for housing \n \nThe NS is managed by an NGO and the costs of running the scheme are shared by the state, philanthropists and overhead charges from places of work. Payments to volunteers are shared between the state and places of work coordinated by the NGO. \n \n3.8. Rwanda’s Model \n \nFrom the above experiences and lessons and based on Rwanda’s context, a blended model (voluntary and compulsory) is adopted for different categories of participants of URUGERERO. The target group for the compulsory category is youth between the ages of 18 – 35 years completing their secondary education. But the board of commissioners of Itorero may change the target group for the compulsory category whenever need for doing so arises. Other categories of the population will be allowed to participant on a voluntary basis depending on their time, professional backgrounds and identified priorities. The number of participants for the national Service (URUGERERO) in each intake shall be determined by the board of commissioners based on the available resources. Priorities to be focused on during National Service (URUGERERO) are identified at least 3 months prior to the commencement of mobilization and training phase begins. The cost of the service shall be shared between the state and beneficiary institutions/organizations. \n \nIn terms of affiliation of ITORERO, the review of other countries’ experiences indicate that some have NS (URUGERERO) under ministry of youth; others under ministry of education while one of the countries has it under the office of the president. Based on our country context, ITORERO commission shall be an independent commission with a reporting line to the Office of the President of the Republic. \n \n4. Rationale \n \nThe ITORERO Program is a home grown initiative that helps to instill positive values in Rwandans especially youth, give back to their communities, promote patriotism, community cohesion, and social responsibility and volunteerism. It enhances the socioeconomic development of our country using integrated approaches some of which are informed by the Rwandan culture and traditions. It is developed in alignment with Rwanda’s long term development strategy (Vision2020), Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and Rwanda’s medium term development strategy (EDPRS). National Service (URUGERERO) can be defined as an organized activity in which people serve the community in ways that contribute to social, economic and political transformation at no financial rewards. The URUGERERO program is aimed at developing programs that enhance the current efforts put in place to accelerate growth in all sectors of the economy by adding a formalized voluntary service component. \n \nThe URUGERERO will also support young people to fulfil their potential and to work together as a community. Each participant will receive practical training (training related to domains of service), training in civic education and basic military training. Participants will be expected to carry out the lessons they have learnt during training by undertaking structured National Service (URUGERERO) work. \n \n5. Benefits of ITORERO in General and Urugerero in particular \n \n Increased solidarity, and strengthened national identity and reduced stereotypic thinking by interfacing with the realities of the communities and the country in general. \n Increased patriotism and civic participation specially among the young generation \n Receive committed, motivated workers at no financial reward. The committed and motivated workers often influence the atmosphere in the work place \n The well-being of beneficiaries is improved with the injection of new compassionate dedicated workers \n Increases Social integration and cohesion \n Self-actualization because of the recognition of participants’ efforts in people’s lives or other forms of change emanating from their efforts \n The participation empowers those involved in different ways including gaining new skills, interaction with others etc. \n Bridging the gap between communities and participants who may not otherwise get such an opportunity \n Gain practical skills that bridges the gap between theory and practices thus \nexposing participants to the world of work \n Increases a sense of responsibility and love for the country \n Increases connection between the well do not and the poor through getting understanding of community life experience. \n Increased opportunities for employment \n \n \n6. Strategic focus \n \n6.1. Vision \n \nThe ITORERO program envisions a population with a value system that promotes voluntary service to the nation with the aim of promoting unity, tolerance, patriotism, democratic governance that lead to sustainable social and economic transformation. \n \n6.2. Mission \n \nEstablish a sustainable institutional framework that enables the willing sections of the population from diverse backgrounds to contribute to their personal growth as well as the well-being of the communities where they live or serve. ITORERO is also aimed at creating an opportunity to enhance positive values; build a sense of responsibility as a citizen to serve the country as well as an opportunity to gain knowledge and professional experience through their service. \n \n6.3. Core Values \n \n Unity – The state of being joined together to form one unit. A genuine vehicle of "the same wisdom, the same vision of the world, and the perception of political life". \n Patriotism – Love and allegiance to the nation and the government of the Republic of Rwanda \n Selflessness – the renunciation of one’s own interests in favour of the interests of others. The spirit of not putting one’s self first but being willing to give one’s time and resources for the benefit of others. \n Integrity – the act of consistency of actions, values, methods, measures, principles, expectations and outcome. \n Responsibility - the obligation and authority to take the necessary actions to ensure success. The obligation for the proper custody, care, and safekeeping of resources entrusted to the possession or supervision of an individual. \n Volunteerism – Volunteering is the practice of people working for a particular cause without payment for their time and services. It is the desire to undertake by choice and free will a task or work for the benefit of the wider community beyond the volunteer’s immediate family and friends \n Humility – defined as a disposition to be humble; a lack of false pride. This attribute increases one’s willingness to listen to others, consult and decide with reliable information. \n \n6.4. Overall goal \n \nThe overall goal of the ITORERO is to empower people to play an active role in their communities’ development, while gaining the experience, knowledge and life skills necessary for employment and fulfilment of their citizenship. The programme will also contribute to achieving national priorities. \n \n6.5. Objectives \n \nIn order to achieve the broader aim of the ITORERO, the following objectives have been set: \n \n To provide the population with civic skills and responsibilities to guard them against negative political influence \n To instil in Rwandans an objective and realistic attitude to life based on National realities \n To accelerate growth using home grown solutions based on our traditions and values \n To provide Rwandans with values and the spirit of selflessness, and community consciousness through voluntary actions. \n To promote patriotic values, national unity and reconciliation and eradicate genocide ideology through shared experiences. \n To enable the Rwandans to appreciate the positive attitudes and merits of individual and collective involvement in national development programs. \n To create a National cadre-ship of disciplined Rwandans especially youths and to develop leadership qualities, personal improvement and attitudes. \n To improve youth employability through skills development, work experience and career guidance. \n \n7. Identity \n \nThe ITORERO program will have its own theme song and logo. Participants will be issued two pairs each of three different types of uniforms: a class uniform, a sports uniform, and a combat uniform to put on during the military training component. The combat uniform's design will be determined by the Board of commissioners. Before the commencement of the URUGERERO, each participant will be allotted a service number and this number is unique for each participant to the different phases of the service. \n \nSymbol and Budge - to be determined by ITORERO Board of Commissioners \nMotto – Patriotic Values and Selfless Service to the Nation \nUniform – to be determined by ITORERO Board of Commissioners \n \n8. Target group \n \nITORERO targets all categories of Rwandans and is intending to design different curricula to suit different sections of the population including children – seven years and above. These will be trained in their IMIDUGUDU with the aim of helping them to grow up as responsible and productive citizens. The compulsory category of the National Service (URUGERERO) will mainly target the youth between the ages of 18-35 completing their secondary education. Other categories of the population desiring to participate will be given the opportunity to do so depending on their time, professional backgrounds and the established Service Priorities. Rwandan citizens living in the Diaspora will also be enticed to join the URUGERERO Program. Non-nationals who may desire to participate and provide service to the country will also allowed the opportunity to do so. University graduates and retired people who have participated in the URUGERERO before but who may wish to participate again will be allowed that opportunity. \n \n9. Implementation framework \n \nThe success of the ITORERO Program requires thorough planning and the active involvement of all stakeholders in the planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. Implementation of this strategy will require effective mobilization of resources to meet the requirements of the ITORERO. A structure to support the implementation of the strategy has been developed and if approved, recruitment of staff will follow. A coordination mechanism has been developed to ensure that activities of ITORERO are properly coordinated at all levels (central and local). \n \n9.1. Management and Coordination Framework \n \nNational coordination is required in order to achieve the desired objectives of the ITORERO. An independent commission will be established with responsibility of planning, implementation, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the ITORERO Programs at all levels. The commission is headed by chairperson, vice chairperson and will have 5 members of the board of commissioners. The commissioners will be working fulltime to provide strategic guidance as well as ensure that the ideological foundation and values of the ITERERO program are rooted in the way of life of Rwandans. This Commission ensures coordination with other stakeholders so that the activities of the ITORERO are well planned and implemented. The specific roles of the Commission include but not limited to the following: \n Creating awareness among Rwandans on the mission, vision and benefits of ITERERO and URUGERERO in particular to the participants in particular and to the nation in general \n Identification of the priority areas of service in partnership with all the relevant stakeholders \n Recruitment and deployment of resources (including human resources). \n Leading the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the ITORERO Programs and activities \n Lead the process of identification of trainers and participants of the National Service (URUGERERO) in particular and ITORERO in general \n Staffing and administration, including payment of allowances, transport and accommodation. \n Budgeting, finance management processes, and allocation of funds and procurement of supplies to support ITORERO programs \n Developing curriculum for different training programs in partnership with relevant stakeholders \n Provision of information and communication services related to ITORERO in general and URUGERERO in particular \n Education and training provision and accreditation/certification of participants \n Supervision and programme assessment. \n Lobbying and advocacy to other partners to support ITORERO and URUGERERO \n \n9.2. The organizational structure of the ITORERO Commission \n \nThe coordination and management structure of the ITORERO Programs comprises the permanent commissioners at the apex with a Chairperson and Vice Chair person. Below the commissioners are four directorates responsible for (1) Finance and Administration (2) Planning Monitoring and Evaluation and (4) Mobilization and Training and (4) National Service. Each of the four directorates has various units responsible for particular Programs of the ITORERO and or support functions (see appendix I). The organizational structure takes into consideration the work of the existing civic training (GUTOZWA) component in addition to the new aspect of National Service/URUGERERO. Due consideration has been given to the fact that ITORERO training goes beyond the participants of URUGERERO and reaches other sections of the Rwandan population who are and will continue to participate in ITORERRO whether they are to join the Service Programs or not. \n \nThe structure has one staff at each district that will be coordinating the ITORERO Programs at the decentralised levels in partnership with the coordination committees at district, sector, cell and umudugudu levels. The existing ITORERO is an ongoing activity targeting all categories of Rwandans and will continue to be so. It is only ITORERO of youth who have completed secondary education that is held once every year and followed by URUGERO. As mentioned earlier, besides the compulsory category of secondary school leavers, URUGERERO will include other categories of youth within the age range of 18-35 years who may join on voluntary basis. \n \n9.3. Headquarters of ITORERO \n \nAs mentioned before, the ITORERO is administered through the ITORERO Commission. The Headquarters of the ITORERO Commission will be in Kigali city with a training centre in NKUMBA. NKUMBA leadership training centre will be strengthened to deliver civic and physical training. It will also be a place where training of trainers and training for members of URUGERERO committees at the decentralised levels will be conducted. Specialised training of URUGERERO participants to prepare them for placements will also be taking place in Nkumba leadership training centre. \n \n9.4. Structure of ITORERO at Decentralised levels \n \nThere will be coordination committees at the District, Sector, Cell and UMUDUGUDU levels to plan and oversee the implementation of ITORERO Programs. Establishment and strengthening of these committees will ensure sustainable planning and implementation of ITORERO at all levels. At each of the above levels, there will be people trained as trainers to deliver training to all categories of the population through ITORERO and also to supervise and monitor the implementation of all programs under ITORERO including URUGERERO. Much of the work related to ITORERO Programs will be planned and implemented at Sector level. The committees at the sector level will be supported by the district liaison officers in ITORERO planning and implementation. \n \n9.5. Commencement of National Service (URUGERERO) \n \nImplementation of the URUGERERO will start in July 2012 with the cohort of ITORERO trainees who will have completed their training in the Fiscal year 2011. This year’s URUGERERO will act as a pilot phase where lessons from it will help the proper planning of the next phases of URUGERERO. All the trained secondary leavers will ITORERO Program Strategy Page 15 of 20 participate in URUGERERO in their own localities but may be deployed to other areas if deemed necessary. \n \n9.6. Length of Service \n \nThe length of service will not be more than 12 months for the compulsory category. The \nactual amount of time for other categories of participants will be determined by the board \nof commissioners. The 12 months period includes 2 months for ITORERO training \n(GUTOZWA) and basic military training and the training specific to their domains of \nservice during URUGERERO. Participants will be eligible to participate in \nURUGERERO only once unless if they choose to participate again. Annual numbers of \nparticipants will be determined by the board of commissioners based on the available \nresources versus National priorities. \nThe time of Service which involves other categories of participants and other youth in not \nmentioned in the compulsory category above will depend on their available time but their \nservice shall not go below one month. There will be exceptional cases depending on the \nskills needed to meet specific priorities. \n \n9.7. ITORERO Phases \n \nThe ITORERO Programs are carried out in 3 phases with monitoring and evaluation occurring at each phase. The M and E will be conducted at the district level and coordinated by the National ITORERO Monitoring and Evaluation Unit at the national level. \n \nThe 3 phases are: \n \n Mobilisation and Training, \n Placement/Serving (URUGERERO) \n Graduation \n \n9.7.1. Mobilization and Training \n \n9.7.1.1. Identification and registration of participants \n \nThe mobilization activity of phase one of ITORERO programs will be an ongoing activity but registration will be starting in September of each year and ending two weeks to the commencement of the training. This will encompass advertising of the scheme and establishing the numbers of participants at each regional training site. This exercise will take a period of two months followed by the training (GUTOZWA) component that will be starting mid November of every year. \n \n9.7.1.2. Training of participants (GUTOZA) \n \nThe training takes place in two phases. The first phase is composed of eight weeks civic training that will be taking place at a number of local training sites. Basic military training will be an integral part of the civic training to instil a sense of discipline, patriotism in the participants and to help them acquire basic skills in self defence. ITORERO Program Strategy Page 16 of 20 Additional one month training specific to the domain of service will be provided to the participants. \n \nAt the beginning of the implementation of this strategy, training of trainers will be conducted to prepare a cadre of trainers in ITORERO identified topics. Periodic reviews to do a gap analysis of trainers will be carried out to ensure that there are no delays or interruptions in the training program calendar emanating from shortage of trainers. Additional training will be organized for new trainers to fill the gap if found. The training to be offered will follow the existing ITORERO curriculum. Standard training modules will be developed to guide all the training programs and this will be done in partnership with curriculum development centre. The modules will be reviewed every year to ensure they are kept relevant. They will include but not limited to Nation Building module, Physical module, Character Building module and National Service module (see annex IV for full description of the modules). The curriculum for specialised training related to the domains of service will be developed by beneficiary institutions in partnership with ITORERO Commission. \n \nParticipants will wear uniforms during the phase of training and the nature of the uniform will be determined by ITORERO board of Commissioners. \n \n9.7.2. Placements \n \nParticipants are deployed to carry out their service depending on their professional backgrounds and the identified priorities but consideration will be given to cost minimization i.e. serving in their areas of residence to minimize cost of transport, accommodation etc will be given priority. Periodic assessments of this approach will be done to ensure that quality is not compromised by the desire to minimize the cost. Placement will last for a period of 9 months which will start immediately after the two phases of training. The priorities for the types of placements will be decided at the district level or by institutions requiring the services of the participants and this will be done at least 3 months before the commencement of training. It is expected that the domains of service will include but are not limited to: \n \n Education (Including literacy and numeracy) \n Health \n Economic affairs and entrepreneurship development \n Infrastructure and IT \n Environment and Conservation \n Safety and Security \n Governance and leadership \n \n9.7.2.1 Support to National Service (URUGERERO) participants \n \nThe participants will be supported in their placements and regularly reviewed to assess the impact of their service on the community, institutions/organizations and on the individual participant. The participants with no other health insurance will be registered with health insurance scheme. Additionally, participants deployed outside their areas of residence will be facilitated to get accommodation, food and other basics needs. The amount of stipend will be determined by the board of commissioners based on the identified needs. \n \n9.7.2.2 Debriefing \n \nEvery quarter, participants in each sector will be coming together to share their experiences and lessons to inform their work for the coming quarter. This is important to help participants debrief, encourage each other and to renew their commitments. \n \n9.7.2.3. Economic Empowerment of Participants \n \nAs part of the support to participants to build economic base and sustainability of the benefits of the ITORERO program, initiatives to promote income generation for the participants will be given strong consideration. Entrepreneurship training will form part of the training programs and those trained will be continually coached to help them come up with bankable income generating projects. They will be linked to the financial services providers to access finances for their IGAs. Additionally, talent development will be promoted as one of ways to promote employment and economic capacity of the participants. Youth with talents in various areas such as music, football, drama etc will be identified and supported to develop their talents in ways that make them fulfilled but also generate sustainable livelihoods for them. \n \n9.7.2.4. Modern face of the ITORERO Program \n \nTo make the program appealing and attractive to the youth, an electronic interactive site where the participants will exchange ideas will be developed. The site will have a chat room, a video library with games and programs that make youth lively at the same time building social networks with peers. The site will also bear the list of youth who have participated in the URUGERERO, their career path including the contribution of URUGERERO to their growth, information on the best practices from the different phases of UURUGERERO, recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the program, different modules used in the training component etc. \n \n9.7.3. Graduation \n \nAt the end of the service period, participants will join together in their respective sites \nto debrief on their experiences and lessons to inform planning for the following \nintake. A closing ceremony will be organized for them and during the ceremony; they \nwill receive a certificate of participation highlighting their contribution and \nexperience acquired in their placements. Exemplary participants will also be \nrecognised at this ceremony. \n \n9.8. Volunteers’ Forum \n \nA forum of volunteers (National and decentralised levels) will be set up to help graduates of URUGERERO program periodically get together to share experiences and best practices to feed into the next phases of the program. The Forum members will elect their representatives who will work closely with ITORERO Commission to continually coordinate their activities including coordination of meetings and supervising their initiatives. ITORERO commission will be supporting the get together of the Forum members but other partners such as Peace CORPS, UNV, and VSO etc will be encouraged to join in and support this initiative. This will also be an opportunity to coordinate and bring harmony to activities of volunteers from different institutions including NGOs. This forum will create awareness among other institutions/organizations working with volunteers to recruit from graduates of URUGERERO program for local or international placements. \n \n9.9. Budget \n \nThe Government will have the overall responsibility for mobilising resources for the ITORERO Programs; however funding partners shall be enticed to come on board to support the program. As mentioned earlier, participants serving outside their areas of residence will be provided with a stipend to cover their basic needs including accommodation and transport. This will be based on the basic cost of living index. Basic health insurance (Mutuelle de santé) will be provided to those not covered by any other health insurance scheme. The initial total budget of the ITORERO Program is 4,604,298,956 frw (see appendix III) includes the human resources that will be needed to coordinate the activities of the ITORERO Commission programs and all other costs related to training, placements, Monitoring and Evaluation. Institutions/organizations requiring URUGERERO participants will be providing the budget to cover the basic needs of the participants during placements but the funds will be pooled together and centrally managed by the ITORERO. \n \n9.10. Stakeholders involved \n \nGiven the cross-cutting nature of the ITOREO programs, different stakeholders are involved in the planning and implementation of these programs. The ITORERO commission will identify key institutions (governmental and non-governmental) that they will be working together to plan and implement. Districts will be responsible for the mobilization of the population for the program, organizing the ITORERO training and identification of priorities for the URUGERERO. Partners will also participate in the monitoring, supervision and evaluation of the activities for all the phases of ITORERO in general and URUGERERO in particular. \n \n9.11. Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting \n \n9.11.1. Monitoring \n \nThe success of the implementation of this strategy will depend on the strength of the \nmonitoring, evaluation and reporting system developed and implemented. The \nmonitoring system gives ongoing information on the process, direction of change, the \npace of change, the magnitude of change and challenges encountered to inform decision \nmaking to improve the program. A Monitoring and Evaluation plan will be developed \nindicating the types of data to be collected, the frequency of data collection, methods of \ndata analysis, persons responsible for data collection and analysis. Monitoring and \nevaluation role cannot be a function of any one person but rather requires involvement of \nall stakeholders at different levels. \n \nThe ITORERO Commission will train its staff and those from relevant stakeholders especially from the districts and sectors in monitoring and quality assurance to ensure that they play a key role in monitoring of the indicators of the ITORERO Programs regularly. Data will be analysed by the monitoring and evaluation unit of ITORERO and shared with relevant stakeholders. \n \nQuarterly review meetings will be organized by the coordination committees at all the \ndecentralised levels with the support of district liaison offers to reflect on the progress, \nchallenges met and propose next steps. This will also be an opportunity to mentor the \nparticipants. \n \nThe ITORERO Commission will develop monitoring tools and guidelines and train staff \nand volunteers in the use of these tools. Information from monitoring will be shared with \ndifferent stakeholders to inform decisions on how best improvements can be made to the \nprograms. \n \n9.11.2. Evaluation \n \nEvaluation will be done periodically to determine the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of the ITORERO programs. The evaluation will help stakeholders to reflect on the achievements against planned results and draw lessons to inform decisions on the performance of the ITORERO Programs. Annual reviews will be done at all levels to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes employed, achievements and take appropriate decisions for the following phases of ITORERO programs. Formal and informal discussions, meetings, workshops for reflecting on the implementation and results will be organized annually. When the monitoring is done well, evaluation work will be made easier since they very much complementary. \n \nAt the end of three years, a comprehensive evaluation of all the aspects of the ITORERO programs will be carried out to look at the effectiveness in achieving expected outcomes and efficiency in optimizing resources. Participatory approach of evaluation will be encouraged to promote ownership and build the capacity of the participants in the evaluation processes. \n \n9.11.3. Reporting \n \nReporting will be done periodically (quarterly, semi-annually and annually) to demonstrate accountability on how we are delivering on promises made to different stakeholders. As mentioned earlier, the sector level will be the primary implementing organ of the ITORERO programs and quarterly, semi-annual and annual reports will be written by sector coordination committee head and submit them to the district coordination committee for review and approval. District liaison officers will consolidate all the reports from the sectors and send them to the ITORERO Commission at the National level for review, consolidation and sharing with stakeholders. A reporting format appropriate to the objectives and indicators of achievement will be developed by the ITORERO Commission and shared with the stakeholders. All coordination committees and staff will be trained in reporting to ensure quality reports are produced. \n \nThe program is split into 4 official modules: \n \n Physical Module - Marching, hand to hand combat, largely similar to taekwondo), weapon training, obstacle courses, canoeing, camping, trainees will be also given mock missions such as: Search and rescue, night patrols, perimeter Guard, first aid and at night trainees guarding their company flag from being stolen by instructors of other companies who would infiltrate their opponent companies' bases \n Nation Building Module - Classroom based. Nation's history, sovereignty and dignity, Rwanda and international affairs, Defense and National Security and Citizen's responsibility to the nation. The classes will be based on group based training \n Character Building Module - Classroom based. This component will be experiential and rely on games and activities as the means of teaching. It will be good values and Self-confidence, leadership and self-evaluation. \n Community Service Module - Trainees will be sent in groups to places in surrounding areas to give the trainees a chance to serve society and environmental restoration and protection."
